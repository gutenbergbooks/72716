<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">On the summit of a grassy hill in Maryland looking across
an arm of the Severn River toward the spreading lawns and
the gray buildings of the Naval Academy stands a stone cross
frosted with marble icicles topping an oddly shaped granite
cairn.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1910, a boy of eighteen fresh from the
Colorado Rockies, I stood, a new midshipman in awkward
sailor whites, before that monument and read the inscription
to Lieutenant Commander G. W. De Long and the officers
and men who perished with him in the <em>Jeannette</em> Expedition
of 1879 in search of the North Pole. Casually I noted that
no one was buried beneath that cross, and since I had never
heard before either of De Long or of the <em>Jeannette</em>, I wandered
off to study the monuments to naval heroes whose
deeds shone out in the histories I had read—the officers who
in the wars with Tripoli had humbled the Barbary pirates;
those who in the Civil War had braved Confederate forts and
ironclad rams to save the Union; and most of all to stand
before the tomb of John Paul Jones, the father of our Navy
and a valiant seaman, fit companion to the great commanders
of all ages.</p>

<p>Over the next twenty years I heard again occasionally of
De Long in connection with the successful expeditions to the
North and to the South Poles, finally reached by Peary and
by Amundsen and those who followed in their footsteps.
But except as a dismal early failure, De Long’s expedition
seemed to have no significance, until some seven years ago a
brief article by a friend of mine, Commander Louis J. Gulliver,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
appeared in the Naval Institute summarizing so splendidly
the history of the <em>Jeannette</em> that immediately that old
stone cross in Annapolis for me took on a new importance
and I began to study what had happened. Reading what I
could get my hands on concerning it, I soon enough saw that
De Long’s early failure was a more brilliant chapter in human
struggle and achievement than the later successes of Peary
and of Amundsen.</p>

<p>But in my early search, based mainly on De Long’s journals
as published nearly sixty years ago, much of what had
happened eluded me; first, because De Long himself, fighting
for the lives of his men in the Arctic, never had opportunity
to set down in his journal what was going on (the most vivid
day of his life is covered by two brief lines); and second,
because the published version of his journal was much
expurgated by those who edited it to create the impression
that the expedition was a happy family of scientists unitedly
battling the ice, whereas the truth was considerably otherwise
as I soon learned.</p>

<p>Fortunately there came into my hands the old record of
the Naval Court of Inquiry into the disaster, before which
court the survivors testified, from which it appeared that
De Long’s struggles with his men tried his soul even as much
as his struggles with the ice; and on top of that discovery,
with the aid of Congressman Celler of New York, I got from
the records of Congress the transcript of a Congressional
Investigation lasting two solid months, a volume of nearly
eleven hundred closely printed pages, from which the flesh
to clothe the skeleton of De Long’s journal immediately
appeared. For there, fiercely fought over by the inquisitors
(Congressional investigations apparently being no different
over half a century ago from what they are today) were the
stories of every survivor, whether officer or man, dragged
out of him by opposing counsel, insistent even that the exact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
words of every controversy, profane as they might be, go
down in the record to tell what really happened in three
years in the ice pack. And there also, never otherwise published,
were all the suppressed reports relating to the expedition,
the expurgated portions of De Long’s journal, and the
unpublished journals of Ambler and of Collins.</p>

<p>From the records of these two inquiries, Naval and Congressional,
backed up by what had been published—the journal
of De Long appearing as “The Voyage of the <em>Jeannette</em>”;
“In the Lena Delta,” by G. W. Melville, chief engineer of
the expedition; and “The Narrative of the <em>Jeannette</em>,” by
J. W. Danenhower, navigator—stood forth an extraordinary
human story. Over this material I worked three years.</p>

<p>How best to tell that story was a puzzle. De Long and the
<em>Jeannette</em> Expedition had already most successfully been embalmed
and buried by loving hands in the sketchy but conventional
historical treatments of the published volumes mentioned
above. To repeat that method was a waste of time. It
then occurred to me that since I had once narrated in the
first person in “On the Bottom” the battle of another group
of seamen (of whom I was one) with the ocean for the
sunken submarine S-51, I might here best give this story life
and reality by relating it in fictional form as the personal narrative
of one of the members of the expedition.</p>

<p>But who should that man be?</p>

<p>It was of course obvious that he must be chosen from the
group of survivors. That narrowed the field to three officers
and eight seamen. Now as between officers and seamen, it
was evident that the officers were in a far better position
to observe and to know what was happening than the seamen,
so the choice was limited to the three surviving officers.
For reasons that will afterwards be clear, among these three
there could hardly be any question—Melville patently was
best. And aside from the fact that Melville was a leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
light in the expedition and next to De Long himself the man
who actually bore the brunt of Arctic fury, he was an engineer,
and since I am also, I could most easily identify myself
with him and with his point of view.</p>

<p>So here as it might have been told about thirty years ago
by Admiral George Wallace Melville, retired Engineer-in-Chief
of the Navy, blunt, loyal, and lovable, a man whose
versatility in four widely dissimilar fields of human endeavor
gave him at his death in 1912 good claim to being considered
one of America’s geniuses, is the Saga of the <em>Jeannette</em>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">This year, 1909, deserves remembrance for one thing at least
aside from the retirement into private life of President Roosevelt.
A few weeks ago through the Virginia Capes steamed
into Hampton Roads our battlefleet, sixteen salt-crusted
veterans of an unprecedented adventure—the circumnavigation
of the globe by an entire fleet. There they were, back
from the distant seas, guns roaring in salute to our president,
flags flying everywhere, whistles from craft of all kinds
shrieking them a welcome home.</p>

<p>Roosevelt, unafraid as always, had sent them out in the
teeth of unnumbered critics who foresaw our battleships with
broken-down machinery rusting in every foreign port from
Valparaiso to Gibraltar, but instead with engines smoothly
turning, the blunt noses of those sixteen battleships plowed
back sturdily into Hampton Roads.</p>

<p>I had never had any fears. I had watched the machinery of
every one of those sixteen ships grow on the drafting tables
of the Bureau of Steam Engineering—pistons, cranks, connecting
rods, boilers, pumps, condensers. My life went into the
design of those engines and boilers on every ship, and from
the flagship <em>Connecticut</em> proudly leading the long line down
to the distant battleship bringing up the rear of the column,
there wasn’t a boiler, there wasn’t a steam cylinder, that
wasn’t part of George Wallace Melville. Under my eyes,
under my guidance, they had grown from ideas on the drawing
board to the roaring kettles and the throbbing engines before
which panting coalheavers and sweating oilers toiled
below to drive those beautiful white hulls round the world
and safely home to Hampton Roads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>But now I can foresee the day of those ships is done, and
I think I have discernment enough left to see that mine is
also. Here in this year 1909, hardly six years since my retirement
as Engineer-in-Chief of the Navy, I look upon the vast
fleet the machinery of which I designed, and I see its passing.
Last year the <em>Lusitania</em>, turbine-driven, speeding across the
Atlantic to a new record, sounded the knell of the huge reciprocating
engines I designed for all those battleships. And
practically completed, waiting to join her older sisters, was
the <em>Delaware</em>, our newest ship, a “dreadnought” so they call
her now, a huge ship of 20,000 tons, but—fired by oil! Her
oil fires spell the doom of the romance of the fireroom—the
stokers, the grimy coalpassers, the slice bar—that pandemonium,
that man-made inferno, with forced-draft fans roaring,
with the clang of coal buckets trolleying from bunker
to fireroom floor, with the glare of the flames on sweating
torsos as the furnace doors swing back and brawny arms heave
in the coal! They’ll all go soon, flying connecting rods and
straining coalheavers, driven out by the prosaic turbine and
the even more prosaic oil burner.</p>

<p>But so it goes. We marine engineers dream, design, and
build, to send forth on the oceans the most beautiful creations
man turns out anywhere on land or sea—but soon our
ships fade from existence like a mist before the sun. For sixteen
years I was Engineer-in-Chief for the Navy, and the
machinery of that battlefleet the nation watched so proudly
steaming home through the Capes was my creation, but I’ve
seen enough in the fifty years since I entered the Navy when
the Civil War broke out to doubt that ten years more will
find a single ship of that armada still in active service. Turbines,
oil burning boilers, bigger guns, heavier armor—they
are crowding in fast now, and soon my ships will go to the
wreckers to make way in the fleet for the bigger and faster
vessels sliding down the building ways in the wake of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
huge <em>Delaware</em>.</p>

<p>Odd how one’s perspective changes with the years! As a
young engineer, I would have believed with those cheering
thousands last month in Hampton Roads that to have had a
guiding hand in creating that fleet would be the high light
in my life—but now I know better. In the end it is how men
lived and died, not the material things they constructed, that
the world is most likely to remember. That is why in my
mind a stone cross in Annapolis Cemetery looms larger and
larger as the years drift by. Years ago, hewn from a driftwood
spar, I set up the original of that cross in the frozen
Lena Delta to stand guard over the bodies of my shipmates;
that stone replica in Annapolis, silent marker of their memory,
will loom up in our history long after there has completely
vanished from the seas every trace of the ships and
the machinery which the world now links with the name of
Melville.</p>

<p>We were seeking the North Pole back in 1879 when I
came to set up that cross. Today, exactly thirty years later,
they’re still seeking it. At this very moment, unheard from
for months, Peary is working north from Greenland. I wish
him luck; he’s following a more promising route than that
one through Behring Sea which we in the <em>Jeannette</em> found
led only to disaster.</p>

<p>It’s strange. The roar of guns in battle, machinery, boilers,
hot engine rooms and flaming firerooms, have made up most
of my life since that day in 1861 when as a young engineer I
entered the Navy to go through the Civil War, but now at
sixty-eight, what sticks most in my mind is still that cruise
of long ago when for two years our boiler fires were either
banked or out, our engine never made a revolution, engineering
went by the board, and with only the Aurora Borealis
overhead to witness the struggle, with me as with all hands
on the <em>Jeannette</em> existence settled into a grim question of ice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
versus ship, and God help us if the ship lost!</p>

<p>We were an odd company there in the <em>Jeannette’s</em> wardroom,
five naval officers and three civilians, drawn together
seeking that chimera, a passage through Behring Sea to the
Pole. De Long, our captain, was responsible mainly for our
being there—George Washington De Long—a man as big as
his namesake, scholarly in appearance, to which a high forehead,
a drooping mustache, and his glasses all contributed,
but in spite of that a self-willed man, decisive, resolute, eager
to be the first to end the centuries old search for what lay
at the Pole. Behind De Long in this affair was James Gordon
Bennett, owner of the <em>New York Herald</em>, and an outstanding
figure in American journalism. Shortly before, Bennett had
won world-wide notice and acclaim for the <em>Herald</em> by sending
Stanley on the seemingly hopeless task of finding Livingstone
in the wilds of unknown Africa and then topped off that
success by backing Stanley’s amazing explorations on the
Congo and the headwaters of the Nile. Bennett, seeking now
fresh worlds to conquer in the interests of journalism, was
easily persuaded by De Long to turn his attention and his
money from conquered equatorial Africa to the undiscovered
Pole. It was Bennett who purchased the <em>Jeannette</em> and put up
the cash to fit her out. But once the ship was bought, Bennett
hardly figured in the actual expedition. That was
De Long’s show from beginning to end. And what an end!</p>

<p>I joined the <em>Jeannette</em> as engineer officer in San Francisco
in April, 1879. An uninviting wreck she looked to me then
alongside the dock at the Mare Island Navy Yard, torn apart
by the navy yard workmen for the strengthening of her hull
and for the installation of new boilers. A checkered history
the <em>Jeannette</em> had had before I ever saw her—originally as the
<em>Pandora</em> of the Royal Navy; then, with guns removed, in the
hands of Sir Allen Young, as a private yacht in which her
owner made two cruises to high latitudes in the Arctic seas.
Finally, she was bought in England from Young by Bennett<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
on De Long’s recommendation as the most suitable vessel
available for the projected polar voyage.</p>

<p>The most suitable she may have been—over that point experts
have wrangled through the years since. So far as I am
concerned, the <em>Jeannette</em> was satisfactory. But the naval constructors
and engineers at Mare Island, California, when
De Long after a passage round the Horn in her sailed his
purchase into the Navy Yard, made no bones about saying
they thought De Long had been badly fooled and the ship
would scarcely do. But what they thought of the <em>Jeannette</em>
was neither here nor there. Bennett had bought her, De Long
was satisfied with her. The criticisms of the naval experts at
Mare Island, three thousand miles away, got little attention
in Washington, where with the power of the <em>New York
Herald</em> behind him and De Long’s enthusiasm to batter down
all opposition, naval or otherwise, Bennett got a bill through
Congress making the <em>Jeannette</em> a naval vessel, and (while
Bennett was still to stand all the expenses of the expedition)
directing the Navy to furnish the personnel and carry the
project through as a naval undertaking.</p>

<p>So when I joined the ship there in San Francisco, I found
her torn to pieces, with Lieutenant Chipp, who was to be
executive officer, and Master Danenhower, slated to go as
navigator, already on the spot following up the alterations
as representatives of De Long. Danenhower, soon promoted
to lieutenant, had joined in Havre and rounded the Horn
with her. Lieutenant Chipp had shortly before arrived from
China to take the post as executive officer. And during the
weeks which followed my own arrival, came the others to
fill out the officers’ mess—Surgeon Ambler; Mr. Collins,
meteorologist; Mr. Newcomb, naturalist; and Mr. Dunbar,
ice-pilot. A queer collection we were, as I well learned
months before De Long’s dying fingers scrawled the last
entry in the <em>Jeannette’s</em> log, and Fate played queer tricks
with us.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Naturally, as her engineer officer, I scanned with deep
interest every detail of the vessel to which I was to trust
my life in the Arctic, and I may say that torn wide open
as she lay when I first saw her, I had an excellent opportunity
to get intimately acquainted with the <em>Jeannette’s</em> scantlings
and with her machinery.</p>

<p>Even for that day, 1879, the <em>Jeannette</em> was a small ship,
hardly 420 tons in displacement. She was only 142 feet long,
25 feet in the beam, and drew but 13 feet of water when
fully loaded. She was a three-master, barque rigged, able in
a fair breeze under full sail to make six knots, which, not to
hold anything back, was almost two knots better than I was
ever able to get her to do with her engines against even an
ordinary sea.</p>

<p>Obviously, not having been built for Arctic service, the
<em>Jeannette’s</em> hull required strengthening to withstand the ice,
and when I first saw her, from stem to stern the ship was a
mad-house, with the shipwrights busily tearing her apart as
a preliminary to reenforcing her hull and otherwise modifying
her for service in the north. Amidships was a huge hole
in her deck through which her original boilers, condemned
by a survey, had been lifted out to be junked. To make more
room for coal (for we were outfitting for a three year cruise)
the old boilers were being replaced by two smaller ones of a
more efficient and compact design, by which device our coal
stowage was increased in capacity nearly fifty per cent—an
achievement of no mean value to a ship which, once we left
Alaska, would have no opportunity to refuel on her voyage.</p>

<p>But this change in the fireroom, radical as it was, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
trifling in comparison with the additions being made to the
hull itself. To strengthen her for ramming into the ice-fields
and to withstand the ice, the bow below the berth deck for
a distance of ten feet abaft the stern was filled in solid with
Oregon pine timbers, well bolted through and through. Outside
in this vicinity, her stern was sheathed with wrought
iron, and from the stern back to the forechains, row on row
laid on horizontally, a series of iron straps was bolted to the
outer planking to shield it from ice damage.</p>

<p>In way of the boilers and engines, completely covering her
side framing, the inside of the ship was sheathed fore and
aft with Oregon pine planks six inches thick, extending from
the boiler bed timbers up the side to the lower deck shelf;
and outside the ship from just above the water line to well
below the turn of the bilge, a doubling of five inches of American
elm had been added, so that the total thickness of the
<em>Jeannette’s</em> side when we finally sailed was over nineteen
inches, a thickness which put her in the class with <em>Old Ironsides</em>
when it came to resisting local penetration.</p>

<p>But the work did not stop there. The sides might be invulnerable
locally but still collapse as a whole like a nut in
a nutcracker when gripped between two ice floes. To resist
any such contingency, in addition to the two original
athwartship bulkheads which supported the sides laterally,
an athwartship truss of massive wood beams, 12 by 14 inches
in section, braced diagonally against the bilges and the lower
side of the main deck, was installed just forward of the new
boilers to bolster the sides amidships; while just abaft these
boilers there was refitted an old iron truss which the ship had
previously carried somewhat further forward. The result of
these additions was that so far as human ingenuity could
provide, the <em>Jeannette</em> was prepared to resist both penetration
and crushing in the ice. Certainly no steamer before her
time had set out better braced to withstand the Arctic ice-fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>My major interest, of course, was with the main machinery.
On the <em>Jeannette</em>, this consisted of two back-acting engines,
each with a thirty-two inch diameter cylinder and an
eighteen inch stroke, developing a total of 200 horsepower
at about 60 revolutions, which on our trials in the smooth
waters of San Francisco Bay, gave the ship a speed of about
five knots. Our shaft led aft through the sternpost to a two-bladed
propeller, nine feet in diameter, so arranged under
a well in the stern that the propeller could be unshipped
and hoisted aboard whenever desired, which clearly enough
was a valuable feature on a vessel subjected to ice dangers.</p>

<p>During our fitting-out period all this machinery was carefully
overhauled, four extra blades for our propeller were
provided; and at my request, two new slide valves for the
main engines were fitted, in order to change the cutoff and
give the engines a greater expansion, which by increasing the
economy of steam consumption would conserve to the
utmost our precious coal.</p>

<p>Aside from the above there were many minor items—the
addition of another auxiliary pump (a No. 4 Sewell and Cameron);
the installation of a complete distillation plant to provide
us with fresh water; and the fitting on deck of a hoisting
and warping winch made of a pair of steam-launch engines
rigged out with the necessary gearing and drums for handling
lines.</p>

<p>Not in my department, but of interest to all hands who
were going to live aboard, were the changes made to the
ship itself to increase its habitability in the north. Material
for a portable deck house to cover our main deck over the
forecastle was furnished us, and all exposed iron work
throughout the vessel was felted over. An entrance porch was
built over the forward end of the poop, leading to the
officers’ quarters, and given to us in a knocked-down state,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
while the insides of both the forecastle and the wardroom
were thickly covered with felt for insulation.</p>

<p>The thousand and one details in fitting out that we had
to go into, I will pass over. De Long was in Washington,
smoothing out difficulties, financial and otherwise, with the
Navy Department, and obtaining all information on previous
polar expeditions, both foreign and domestic, on which
he could possibly lay a hand. Consequently all through the
spring, on Chipp, on Danenhower, and on myself at Mare
Island fell the task of following up the repairs and alterations;
of getting the most we could done to the ship at the
least expense; and as every naval officer who has ever taken
his ship through an overhaul period well knows, of battling
through the daily squabbles between ship’s officers and navy
yard personnel as to who knew better what ought to be done
and how best to do it. We did our utmost to tread on no
one’s toes, but from the beginning the officers at the Navy
Yard regarded the <em>Jeannette</em> herself as unsuitable for a serious
polar voyage, and this hardly led to complete harmony
between them and us; an unfortunate situation which I think
may have also been aggravated somewhat by doubts on their
part about what the <em>Jeannette</em> Expedition was really intended
for—a newspaper stunt for the glorification of James Gordon
Bennett, or a bona fide attempt to add to the scientific knowledge
of the world? But whatever their feelings, they did a
thorough job on the ship, even though the cost, about
$50,000, must have been something of a shock to Mr. Bennett,
who, after paying for the repairs previously made to
the <em>Jeannette</em> in England, probably felt the vessel ready to
proceed to the Pole with only a perfunctory stop at Mare
Island to take aboard stores and crew. And I know, especially
in the beginning of this fitting-out period, that De Long
himself was on tenter-hooks for fear that the cost of all these
unexpected repairs and replacements would cause Bennett<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
to abandon the enterprise. He was constantly in his letters
from Washington cautioning us to use our ingenuity and our
diplomacy with the Yard’s officers to affect every practicable
economy, and whenever possible within the terms of the Act
of Congress taking over the <em>Jeannette</em>, to see that costs, especially
for materials furnished, were absorbed by the Navy
itself and not lodged against the expedition.</p>

<p>So we struggled along through April, May, and June, with
my dealings on machinery mainly with Chief Engineer
Farmer of the Navy Yard, while Chipp worked with Naval
Constructor Much who handled all the hull work at Mare
Island, and Danenhower confined himself to disbursing the
funds and watching the accounts. The two new boilers
(originally intended for the U.S.S. <em>Mohican</em> but diverted to
us to expedite completion) were finally dropped into our
hold, the beams and decking replaced, and the <em>Jeannette</em>,
though life aboard was still a nightmare as the vessel rang
from end to end under the blows of shipwrights’ mauls and
caulking hammers, once more began to look something like
a ship instead of a stranded derelict.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Meanwhile our crew was being assembled, an unusual group
naturally enough in view of the unusual nature of our projected
voyage.</p>

<p>Of Lieutenant De Long, captain of the <em>Jeannette</em>, originator
of the enterprise, and throughout its existence the
dominant spirit in it, I have already spoken. The choice of
the others who made up the expedition, especially of those
ranked as officers, rested with him. Good, bad, or indifferent,
they were either selected by him or met his approval; no
one else was to blame if, before our adventure ended, of some
he wrote in the highest terms while others were at various
times under arrest by his orders, and with one at least he was
engaged in a bitter feud that lasted to the death of both.</p>

<p>Second in command was Lieutenant Charles W. Chipp,
whom I have already briefly noted in connection with the
repairs. He came all the way from the China Station to join
the ship as executive officer. Chipp, of moderate height,
who in appearance always reminded me of General Grant
due both to his beard and his eyes, was a calm, earnest, reticent
sort of person, serious, rarely given to smiles, and a first
class officer. He was an old shipmate of De Long’s in the
U.S.S. <em>Juniata</em>, and together they had had some previous
Arctic experience when in 1873 their ship was sent north to
the relief of the lost <em>Polaris</em>. On this mission, when the
<em>Juniata</em>, not daring because of ice conditions to venture
farther north, was stopped at Upernavik, Greenland, both
De Long and Chipp cruised together for nearly two weeks
in a small steam launch several hundred miles farther to the
northward, searching among the bergs of Baffin Bay for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
<em>Polaris’</em> crew. To their great disappointment they failed to
find them, a circumstance not however their fault, since
unknown to the searchers, the <em>Polaris</em> survivors had already
been rescued by a Scotch whaler and taken to Great Britain.
On this hazardous voyage, covering over 700 miles in a
33 foot steam launch, amidst the bergs and gales of Baffin
Bay, Chipp as De Long’s second got his baptism of ice, and
in all the intervening years from that adventure, even from
the distant Orient, he kept in close touch with De Long,
eager if his shipmate’s dreams of a polar expedition of his own
ever materialized, to take part. When early in 1878, the
<em>Pandora</em> was finally purchased in England, Chipp was in
China, attached to the U.S.S. <em>Ashuelot</em>. Upon learning of this
concrete evidence of progress toward the Pole, he tried
strenuously to secure his immediate detachment and join
the renamed <em>Pandora</em> in England for the trip round the Horn,
but in this he was unsuccessful, and it was not until late
April, 1879, that by way of the Pacific he finally arrived
from Foo Chow to join us in San Francisco.</p>

<p>The third and last of the line officers was Master John W.
Danenhower, navigator, who a few weeks after we sailed, in
the regular course of naval seniority, made his number as a
lieutenant. Danenhower, the youngest of the officers aboard,
having been out of the Naval Academy only eight years
at the time, was during the summer of 1878 on the U.S.S.
<em>Vandalia</em>, convoying ex-President Grant, then at the height
of his popularity, on a triumphal tour of the Mediterranean.
Here, off the coast of Asia Minor, the news of Bennett’s purchase
of the <em>Pandora</em> for a polar expedition reached him.
Whether prompted by youthful exuberance or a desire to
escape the heat of the tropics, I never knew, but at any rate,
Danenhower promptly got in touch, not with De Long, but
with Bennett, offering his services, and shrewdly enough
backing up his application with an endorsement obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
from the <em>Vandalia’s</em> distinguished passenger, General Grant
himself!</p>

<p>For the owner of a Republican newspaper, this was more
than sufficient. Bennett promptly accepted him, subject only
to De Long’s approval. Scheduled shortly to sail from Havre
to San Francisco with the <em>Jeannette</em> and confronted with the
imperative need of finding immediately to help him work
the ship some assistant in the place of the distant Chipp who
was still ineffectually struggling in China to get his detachment,
De Long gladly assented to this solution. Between Bennett,
General Grant, and the cables, Navy red tape was
rudely cut, Danenhower’s transfer swiftly arranged, and
after a hasty passage by steamer and train across the Mediterranean
and Europe, he arrived from Smyrna shortly before
the <em>Jeannette</em> shoved off from Havre.</p>

<p>Danenhower, hardly thirty when we started, masked his
youth (as was not uncommon in those days) behind an ample
growth of sideburns. Unlike his two seniors in the Line, he
had had no previous Arctic experience of any kind, but he
was enthusiastic, impetuous, big in frame, strong and husky,
and from all appearances better able than most of the rest
of us to withstand the rigors of the north.</p>

<p>Concerning myself, then a passed assistant engineer in
the Navy with the rank of lieutenant, little need be said. Of
all the regular officers on the <em>Jeannette</em>, I was the oldest both
in length of service and in years, being at the time we set
out thirty-eight and having entered the Navy when the war
began in 1861 as a third assistant engineer. My years in the
poorly ventilated and hot engine rooms of those days had
cost me most of my hair, but to compensate for this, I had
the longest and fullest beard aboard the <em>Jeannette</em>, which I
think gave me somewhat of a patriarchal appearance to
which however my age hardly entitled me. Oddly enough,
my first polar service was coincident with that of De Long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
and Chipp, for I was engineer officer of the U.S.S. <em>Tigress</em>,
also searching Baffin Bay in 1873 for the <em>Polaris</em> survivors
when we fell in with the <em>Juniata’s</em> launch, officered by De
Long and Chipp, on the same mission searching off Cape
York. When the launch had exhausted its small coal supply
and returned to the <em>Juniata</em> we in the <em>Tigress</em> (which was
really a purchased whaler and therefore better suited for the
job than a regular naval vessel like the <em>Juniata</em>) continued
the task.</p>

<p>My first acquaintance with De Long had come however
several years earlier than this, when in the sixties, we were
shipmates on the U.S.S. <em>Lancaster</em> on the South Atlantic Station,
where in spite of the fact that he was on deck and I
in the engine room, we got to know each other well. It was
as a result of this friendship and the interest in polar research
I had myself acquired on the <em>Tigress</em> that at De Long’s suggestion,
I volunteered my services for the <em>Jeannette</em>. I had
some difficulty getting the berth, however, for the Bureau of
Steam Engineering, being hard pressed for personnel, was
loath to let anyone in the Bureau itself go.</p>

<p>So far as her operation as a ship went then, these four of
us, three officers of the Line, De Long, Chipp, and Danenhower,
and one officer of the Engineer Corps, myself, made
up the commissioned personnel of the <em>Jeannette</em>.</p>

<p>We had with us one more officer of the regular navy.
Passed Assistant Surgeon James M. Ambler, a native of Virginia
and a naval surgeon since 1874. Upon the recommendation
of the senior medical officers of the Navy, Ambler was
asked by De Long to take the berth, and gladly accepted.</p>

<p>I met Ambler for the first time on the <em>Jeannette</em>. Quiet,
broad of brow, dignified in manner and bearing, of amazing
vitality, he impressed me from the first both as an excellent
shipmate and as a competent surgeon to whose skill, far from
hospitals and resources of civilization, we might safely trust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
our health in the Arctic. And in this belief, the hazards of the
months to come proved we were not mistaken.</p>

<p>These five mentioned, regularly commissioned in the
Navy, comprised the whole of those technically entitled to
be considered as officers, but in the wardroom mess we had
three others, Collins, Newcomb, and Dunbar, who came into
that category in spite of the fact that they were shipped as
seamen. The Act of Congress taking over the vessel authorized
the Secretary of the Navy to detail such naval officers
as could be spared and were willing to go, but as for the
rest of the crew, it permitted only the enlistment of others
as “seamen” for this “special service.” To some degree this
created a dilemma which from the beginning had in it the
seeds of trouble, for as a scientific expedition, Bennett desired
to send along certain civilians. These gentlemen, who
obviously were not seamen, and who felt themselves entitled
to consideration as officers (in which belief the rest of us
willingly enough concurred) were nevertheless informed by
the Navy Department that legally they could go only as “seamen
for special service” or not at all. How they were to be
considered aboard ship and what duties they might be assigned,
would rest with the commanding officer. This fiat
of the Department, a bitter pill for the men concerned to
swallow, was soon ameliorated by De Long’s assurance that
those affected were to be treated as officers, and on this understanding
Collins, Newcomb, and Dunbar were accordingly
shipped as “seamen for special service.” And then and
there was laid the basis of a quarrel which long after those
involved were stretched cold in death, mercifully buried by
the snowdrifts on the bleak tundras of the Lena Delta, still
raged in all the unbridled malevolence of slander and innuendo
through naval courts and the halls of Congress, venomously
endeavoring to besmirch both the living and the dead.</p>

<p>Jerome J. Collins, of the staff of the <em>New York Herald</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
was appointed by Mr. Bennett as meteorologist of the expedition,
but was obviously aboard mainly as a newspaper man.
Collins, a big man with a flowing mustache but no beard,
was active, energetic, eager in a news sense to cover the expedition,
often in trouble with the rest of us, for the usual
naval temperament, taught to regard the captain’s word as
law, was wholly missing in <em>this</em> newspaper man’s ideas of the
freedom befitting a reporter. Collins’ appointment as meteorologist
was natural enough for he ran the weather department
of the <em>Herald</em>, though scientifically his knowledge of
meteorology was superficial. But he plunged whole-heartedly
into the subject, and aided by De Long who got him access
both to the Smithsonian Institution and to the Naval Observatory,
he absorbed all he could on meteorology in the few
months which elapsed while we were fitting out.</p>

<p>Still, shipping as a “seaman” rankled in Collins’ soul; a
small thing to worry over perhaps, but he was overly sensitive
and often took offense when none was meant. Many
times since have I wondered whether Collins, the only one
amongst the wardroom mess not born an American, may not,
like many immigrants, have been unduly tender on that
account and therefore imagined subtle insults in the most
casual comments of his shipmates about his birthplace,
Ireland.</p>

<p>Our other civilian scientist was Raymond Lee Newcomb
of Salem, Massachusetts, naturalist and taxidermist of the expedition.
Newcomb, serious, slight in build, small as compared
to the rest of us, seemed at first glance ill adapted to stand
the gaff of a polar voyage, but technically he was a good
naturalist and that settled his appointment, in spite of his
boyish manner.</p>

<p>Last of all those comprising the wardroom mess was William
Dunbar, ice-pilot, who hailed from New London and
had been a whaler all his life, had commanded whalers in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
the Behring Sea, and of all those aboard, had had the longest
and the most thorough knowledge of ice, ice packs, and the
polar seas. By far the oldest man aboard, either in the wardroom
or in the forecastle, Dunbar’s grizzled face, gray hairs,
and fund of experience gave his words on all things Arctic
an air of authority none of the rest of us could muster, and
on his knowledge and sagacity as ice-pilot, we rested mainly
our hopes of navigating the <em>Jeannette</em> safely through the ice-fields.</p>

<p>These were the eight that made up the <em>Jeannette’s</em> wardroom
mess, each in his own way looking to the ice-fields
and the mysterious regions of the Pole as the path to knowledge,
to adventure, or to fame. Instead, even after thirty
years, my heart still aches when I recall what the ice did to
us and where for most of us that path led.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Throughout May and June we were busy loading stores,
coaling ship, running our trials, cleaning up the odds and ends
of our alterations, and signing on the crew.</p>

<p>De Long in Washington, deluged from all over the country
with requests from young men, old men, cranks, and
crackpots of every type, eager to go along in all sorts of
ridiculous capacities, diplomatically solved his difficulty by
rejecting each claim in about the same letter to all:</p>

<p>“I have room in the <em>Jeannette</em> for nobody but her officers
and crew. These must be seamen or people with some claim
to scientific usefulness, but from your letter I fail to learn
that you may be classed with either party.”</p>

<p>And then, having thus disposed of the undesirables, from
Washington he wrote the <em>Jeannette</em>, carefully instructing
Chipp as to the essential requirements for the seamen he desired
to have signed on:</p>

<p>“Single men, perfect health, considerable strength, perfect
temperance, cheerfulness, ability to read and write English,
prime seamen of course. Norwegians, Swedes, and Danes preferred.
Avoid English, Scotch, and Irish. Refuse point-blank
French, Italians, and Spaniards. Pay to be Navy pay. Absolute
and unhesitating obedience to every order, no matter
what it may be.”</p>

<p>De Long’s instructions with respect to nationalities were
based mainly on his assumptions with regard to their supposed
abilities to withstand the rigors of the north, but they
seemed to me to a high degree humorous when I consider
that I, of Scotch descent, fell in the class to be “avoided,”
while De Long himself of French Huguenot parentage, came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
in the group “to be refused point-blank.”</p>

<p>How little the average American of that day went to sea
may be inferred from the fact that it did not even enter
De Long’s mind to mention “Americans” among the various
categories to be considered for his crew, though not forty
years before in the heyday of wooden ships, the sails of
Yankee clippers manned by Yankee seamen, whitened every
ocean.</p>

<p>In early June, De Long came west and at Mare Island
joined us to witness the final completion and trial of the
ship. Completely satisfied with the changes made in the ship,
he had nothing but praise for the manner in which we, his
three subordinates, had carried on in his absence, and waved
aside the gloomy prognostications of the Navy Yard officers
and their comments about inadequate spars and sails, improper
shape of hull, and (to put it briefly) the <em>Jeannette</em>
as a whole, which they damned euphemistically in their official
trial report:</p>

<p>“<em>So far as practicable</em>, we are of the opinion that she has
been repaired and placed in condition for service in the
Arctic Ocean.”</p>

<p>But on one thing, securing an escort as far as Alaska,
De Long had firmly set his heart. He was anxious to get
from San Francisco into the Arctic as rapidly as possible
to take advantage of what summer weather he could in
working his way north. The weather at sea to be expected
being mostly head winds, speed meant proceeding under
steam rather than under sail on the long trip to Alaska. This
of necessity would use up most of our coal, forcing us to
start the Arctic part of our journey with our bunkers either
empty or what was almost as bad, full of such inferior and
almost unburnable coal as was available in Alaska; unless an
escort ship accompanied us as far as the Arctic Circle to replenish
our bunkers then with the excellent anthracite obtainable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Regardless, however, of all his arguments and his persuasions,
De Long was unable to get the commandant at Mare
Island to approve the detail of any naval vessel for this duty;
nor, with Bennett unfortunately abroad, did he have, in spite
of his most urgent telegrams, any better luck in forcing the
Navy Department itself to order one. In this dilemma, at the
last minute Bennett saved the situation by a cable from Paris,
authorizing the charter of a schooner, the <em>Fanny A. Hyde</em>,
to carry the coal north. De Long, relieved of his worry but
exasperated beyond measure by the controversy, eased his
mind by wiring back to the <em>Herald</em>,</p>

<p>“Thank God, I have a man at my back to see me through
when countries fail!”</p>

<p>On June 28, the <em>Jeannette</em> was commissioned as a ship of
the Navy. Thirty years have passed since then, but still that
gay scene is as fresh and bright in my memory as only yesterday.
Our entire ship’s company was mustered on the poop
for the ceremony, officers in the glitter of swords, gold lace,
and cocked hats to starboard, seamen in sober navy blue to
port. Between those lines of rough seamen about to dare the
Arctic ice, Emma De Long stepped forth, as fresh and lovely
on that June day as summer itself, the very embodiment of
youthful feminine grace if ever I have seen it in any port on
this earth. With a dazzling smile that seemed to take in not
only our captain but every member of his crew as well, she
manned the halliards and amidst the hoarse cheers of the
sailors swiftly ran aloft our flag, a beautiful silken ensign
lovingly fashioned for her husband’s ship by the slender fingers
which for the first time now hoisted it over us. And
then with a seagoing salute as our new banner reached the
masthead, she passed the halliards to the quartermaster,
stepped back to De Long’s side, and clung proudly to his
arm while he read the orders detailing him to the command,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and the commandant of the Navy Yard, Commodore Colhoun,
formally (and no doubt thankfully) turned the ship
over to him.</p>

<p>A few days later, under our own steam we moved from
Mare Island to San Francisco and there, away from the din
of the yard workmen finally, we finished in peace loading
stores in preparation for departure.</p>

<p>At last, on July 8, 1879, with the North Pole as our destination,
the <em>Jeannette</em> weighed anchor, and gaily dressed out
in all her signal flags, slowly steamed through the harbor,
escorted by all the larger craft of the San Francisco Yacht
Club, while as an indication of the esteem of Californians
generally, Governor Irwin himself accompanied us to sea
aboard a special tug.</p>

<p>That was a gala day for San Francisco, climaxing a week
of banquets and farewell parties given for us in the city.
Telegraph Hill was black with cheering crowds; on every
merchant vessel in the bay as we passed flags dipped and
impromptu salutes rang out. From the Presidio, a national
salute blazed from the fortifications as we passed, the Army’s
godspeed on our mission to their brothers of the Navy. It
was well the Army saluted us, for that was the only official
salute we received on our departure. De Long, much chagrined,
noted as I noted, that not a single naval vessel, not
a single naval officer, took part in the ovation at our departure,
and that though three warships, the <em>Alaska</em>, the
<em>Tuscarora</em>, and the <em>Alert</em>, lay at the Navy Yard only twenty-six
miles away, and one of them at least might have been
sent for the purpose. And as if to emphasize the point, the
navy yard tug <em>Monterey</em>, which that very morning had
brought the commandant down to San Francisco on other
business, not only lay silently at her wharf while we steamed
by her, but fifteen minutes later crossed our wake hardly a
mile astern of us and without even a blast of her whistle as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
a farewell, steamed off in the direction of Mare Island.</p>

<p>From the machinery hatch where I was keeping one eye
out for my clumsy engines and the other out for my last
long glimpse of home, I watched in puzzled surprise as the
<em>Monterey</em> silently disappeared astern, then looking up at the
bridge nearly overhead, caught a glimmer of a wry smile on
De Long’s face as he watched the <em>Monterey</em>. A navy expedition,
we were sailing without the presence of a single naval
representative in that vast crowd of men and ships cheering
us on; worse perhaps, for it seemed as if we were being studiously
ignored. Why? I have often wondered. Not enough
rank on the <em>Jeannette</em>, perhaps.</p>

<p>But this was the only cloud on our departure, and I doubt
if overwhelmed in the roar of the guns from the Presidio, the
cheers from the citizens of San Francisco, and the shrieking
of whistles from the flag-decorated vessels we passed, others,
especially civilians, ever noticed it.</p>

<p>Slowly, under engines only, we steamed out the Golden
Gate and met the long swells of the Pacific. Astern, one by
one the escorting yachts turned back. On the starboard wing
of the bridge at her husband’s side stood Emma De Long,
a sailor’s daughter, and after a hectic courtship terminating
finally in a sudden shipboard marriage in the far-off harbor of
Le Havre, for eight years now a sailor’s wife. Silently she
looked forward through the rigging, past furled sails, past
yards and mast and bowsprit, across the waves toward the unknown
north. Occasionally she smiled a little at De Long, rejoicing
with him on the surface at least that at last his dream
had come true, her eyes shining in her pride in the strength
and the love of the man by whom she stood. But what her
real feelings were, I, a rough seaman, could only guess, for
she said nothing as she clung to the rail, her gaze riveted over
the sea to the north into which in a few brief hours were to
disappear forever her husband and her husband’s ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>We stood on a few miles more. The coast line astern became
hazy, our escorting fleet of yachts dwindled away to
but one. Then a bell jangled harshly in the engine room
below me, the engines stopped. For a few brief minutes the
<em>Jeannette</em> rolled in the swells while to the shrilling of the
silver pipe in the mouth of Jack Cole, bosun, our starboard
whaleboat was manned, lowered, and shoved off, carrying
toward that lone yacht which now lay to off our quarter,
Emma De Long and her husband. There in that small boat,
tossing unevenly in the waves a shiplength off, was spoken
the last farewell. A brief embrace, a tender kiss, and De Long,
balancing himself on the thwarts, handed his wife up over the
low side of the yacht.</p>

<p>Another moment, and seated in the sternsheets of the
whaleboat, De Long was once more simply the sailor. Sharply
his commands drifted across the waves to us,</p>

<p>“Shove off!”</p>

<p>The bowman pushed clear of the yacht.</p>

<p>“Let fall!”</p>

<p>In silence, except for the steady thrash of the oars, our
whaleboat came back to us, rounded to under the davits, was
hoisted aboard. Again the bell jangled below. Our engines
revolved slowly, the <em>Jeannette</em> sluggishly gathered speed,
the helmsman pointed her west northwest. Off our quarter,
the yacht came about, swiftly picked up headway, and with
the two ships on opposite courses, she dropped rapidly astern.
For a few minutes, with strained eyes I watched a white
handkerchief fluttering across the water at us, then it faded
in the distance. The bosun secured the whaleboat for sea,
piped down, and without further ceremony, the sea routine
on the <em>Jeannette</em> commenced. I took a final look at the distant
coast and went below to watch the operation of my
engines at close range.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Of our passage to the Alaskan Peninsula, there is not much
to record. It was a shakedown cruise literally enough. The
<em>Jeannette</em>, between the newly added weight of her hull reenforcements
and the excessive amount of stores and coal
aboard, was so grossly overloaded she had hardly two feet
freeboard left amidships, and she labored so heavily in the
seas as a consequence that for seagoing qualities, I do her no
injustice when I say that as a ship she was little superior to
various of Ericsson’s ironclad monitors with which I fell in
on blockade duty during the late war. Indeed, had it not
been for our masts and spars, our nearly submerged hull
would no doubt have pleased even John Ericsson himself as
affording a properly insignificant target for enemy gunfire.</p>

<p>From our second day out, when the breeze freshened a
bit from the northwest and De Long, easing her off a few
points to the southward, spread all our canvas to take advantage
of it, we were under both sail and steam, but with the
seas breaking continuously over our rail and our decks awash
most of the time. With our negligible freeboard, we lifted to
nothing but took all the seas aboard as they came, rolling
heavily and wallowing amongst the waves about as gracefully
as a pig in a pen.</p>

<p>In this wise, we discovered a few things, among them the
fact that we were burning five tons of coal a day and making
only four knots with our engines, which gave us hardly a
hundred miles for a day’s run. Lieutenant Chipp, an excellent
seaman if there ever was one but who had not before
been out in the <em>Jeannette</em>, was certain he could do as well
under sail alone as I was doing under steam, with a consequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
saving of our coal, and persuaded the captain to let
him try. So below we banked our fires, while the sailors racing
through the rigging loosed all our square sails in addition
to the fore and aft rig we already had set.</p>

<p>It was interesting to watch Chipp’s disillusionment. With
all canvas spread up to the fore and main topgallant sails
(the <em>Jeannette</em> carried nothing above these) Chipp started
bravely out on the starboard tack, but in the face of a northwest
breeze, he soon found that like most square riggers, she
sailed so poorly by the wind, he had to pay her off and head
directly for Hawaii before we began to log even four knots.
That was bad enough but worse was to come. Having spent
most of the afternoon watch experimenting with the trim
of the sails, Chipp finally arrived at a combination to which
we logged about four and a half knots, though in the direction
of our destination, Unalaska Island, we were making
good hardly three. Thus trimmed we ran an hour while the
seagoing Chipp in oil skins and boots sloshed over our awash
deck from bowsprit to propeller well, his beard dripping water,
his eyes constantly aloft, studying the set of every sail
from flying jib to spanker in the hope of improving matters.</p>

<p>In this apparently his inspection gave him no cause for
optimism, for after a final shake of the head, he decided to
come about and try her on the port tack, to see if by any
chance she sailed better there, as is occasionally the case with
some ships owing to the unsymmetrical effect of the drag
of the screw. Stationing himself amidships, Chipp gave the
orders.</p>

<p>Down went the wheel. Then came the final shock. To
his great discomfiture, Chipp was wholly unable to bring
the lumbering <em>Jeannette</em> into the wind and come about!
Twice he tried, only to have the ship each time hang “in
irons” with yards banging and sails flapping crazily till she
fell off again and picked up headway on her old tack. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
two failures, De Long tried his hand at it, then Danenhower
made an attempt, but in spite of the nautical skill of all her
deck officers and the smart seamanship of her crew, the
<em>Jeannette</em> simply could not be made to tack. For all they
could do under sail, the <em>Jeannette</em> might still be on that starboard
tack headed for Honolulu, if the captain had not finally
given up in disgust and roared out to his executive officer in
the waist of the ship struggling with the sheets to square away
for another attempt,</p>

<p>“Belay that! Leave her to me, Chipp! I’ll tack this tub!”
and reaching for the bell pull, he rang the engine room,</p>

<p>“Full speed ahead!”</p>

<p>Knowing De Long’s impetuous nature, I had for some
time been suspecting such a result and in the engine room, I
had both coalheavers and engineers standing by, so I was
ready with both boilers and machinery. I yanked open the
throttle myself, and our back-acting connecting rods began
to shuttle athwartships. Quickly our shaft came up to fifty
revolutions. Above I heard the captain bellow,</p>

<p>“Hard a’ lee!”</p>

<p>This time, driven by her screw, the <em>Jeannette</em> maintained
her headway, came obediently up into the wind, fell off to
starboard, and quickly filled away on the port tack. When
I poked my head above the machinery hatch coaming to observe
results, there was the crestfallen Chipp just outboard
of me, busily engaged in securing all on his new course, and
I could not resist, a little maliciously, suggesting to him,</p>

<p>“Hey, brother! You want to stay at sea? Well, while
you’re still young enough to learn, take my advice and study
engineering. Sailing ships? In a few years, they’ll all be as
dead as triremes! Better start now. Let me lend you a good
book on boilers!”</p>

<p>But Chipp, still hardly willing to believe that he was
beaten, seized a belaying pin, waved it in my direction, retorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
hotly,</p>

<p>“Get below with your greasy machinery and sooty boilers!
They’re the ruination of any vessel! Sails dead, eh? Unship
that damned propeller of yours and I’ll tack her!” He
jammed his sou’wester viciously down over his ears and
ignoring my offer strode forward to check the set of the
jibs.</p>

<p>De Long, leaning over the bridge, peering down at me
over his dripping glasses, took my gibe at sails more philosophically.</p>

<p>“Well, chief,” he observed, “she handles now like nothing
I ever sailed in before, but I suppose it’s my fault, not
hers, she’s so low in the water. When we’ve burned some of
this coal and lightened up, perhaps she’ll do better.” He
puffed meditatively at his pipe while he turned to examine
the compass. We were hardly within six points of the wind.
In dismay De Long muttered, “Heading north! This course
will never do if we want to get to Alaska this season. I guess
we’ll have to douse sail, stick to the engines, and lay her
dead into the wind, west nor’west for Unalaska, till the
breeze shifts anyway.” He cupped his hands, shouted after
his first officer,</p>

<p>“Mr. Chipp!”</p>

<p>Chipp, just passing the fore shrouds, turned, looked inquisitively
up at the bridge.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chipp, furl all sail! We’ll proceed under steam alone
till further orders!”</p>

<p>For three days we kicked along with unfavorable weather
through rain, mist, and head seas. The <em>Jeannette</em> labored,
groaned, and with no canvas to steady her, rolled and pitched
abominably. Our two scientists, Newcomb and Collins, at
the first roll went under with seasickness, and as the weather
grew worse their misery passed description, though as is
usual in such cases, they got scant comfort from the rest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
us. What queer quirk of the seagoing character it is that
makes the sailor, ordinarily the most open-hearted and sympathetic
of human beings, openly derisive of such sufferings,
I know not, but we were no exceptions, and towards Collins
in particular, whose puns had occasionally made some of us
in the wardroom self-conscious, we were especially barbed
in our expressions of mock solicitude.</p>

<p>But if the seasickness of our men of science excited only
our mirth, no such merry reaction greeted our discovery that
Ah Sam, our Chinese cook, was also similarly indisposed. At
first that Ah Sam was seasick was solely a deduction on our
part to account for his complete disappearance from the galley,
and the fact that for meal after meal we had to make
out in the messroom with only such cold scraps as Charley
Tong Sing, the steward, dished out. But when two days
went by thus, Ah Sam’s whereabouts became a matter of
concern to all of us and especially to the doctor. Still where
he had stowed himself, even the bosun could not discover,
and to all our inquiries about Ah Sam and to all our complaints
about the food, we got from Charley only a shake of
the head and in a high singsong the unvaried reply,</p>

<p>“Ah Sam, he velly sick man now. Cholly Tong Sing, he
no feel so good too.”</p>

<p>With this unsatisfactory state of affairs in our supply department
we had perforce to remain content, until after three
days of total eclipse, Ah Sam rose again, one might say, almost
from the dead.</p>

<p>I had just come up from the humid engine room to the
main deck, and still bathed in perspiration, had paused to get
my lungs full of fresh salt air before diving aft into the
shelter of the poop. For a moment, with the wind blowing
through my whiskers, I clung to the main shrouds. With both
feet braced wide apart on the heaving deck, I stood there
cooling off, when from the open passage to the port chartroom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
which was the as yet unused workroom for Newcomb’s
taxidermy, I heard in the doctor’s unmistakable Virginian
accent,</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be damned! Lend a hand here, Melville!”</p>

<p>I poked my head through the door. Ambler, who I afterwards
learned had been tracking down the source of some
mysterious groans, had pulled open a locker beneath the
chart table, and there, neatly fitted into that confined space,
was the lost Ah Sam!</p>

<p>I gasped. Have you ever seen a seasick Chinaman? The
combination of Ah Sam’s natural yellow complexion with
the sickly green pallor induced beneath his skin by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal de
mer</i>, gave him a ghastly appearance the like of which no ordinary
corpse could duplicate. To this weird effect his
shrunken body contributed greatly, for he had certainly disgorged
everything he had ever assimilated since emigrating
from China. (The evidence for this apparently exaggerated
statement was such as to convince the most incredulous, but
I will not go into details.)</p>

<p>Surgeon Ambler, holding his nose with one hand, grabbed
Ah Sam by the pigtail and unceremoniously jerked him forth.
Immediately Ah Sam sagged to the deck, his eyes rolling
piteously.</p>

<p>Also holding my nose, I seized our cook by one shoulder
and dragged him out on deck, where the surgeon gave him
a dose of chloroform, which composed him somewhat. Why
he had not already died, shut up in that locker, I cannot
comprehend except on the assumption that he grew up in
one of those stinkpot factories which Chipp, who was an
authority on that country, claimed Chinese pirates maintain.
But fearful lest he die yet unless kept out in the air, the
captain planked him down at the lee wheel, where under
the constant eye of the helmsman, he could not again crawl
off to hide in some glory hole. There, clutching with a death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
grip at the spokes as the wheel spun beneath his fingers,
Ah Sam stayed till next day, a fearful sight with pigtail flying
in the breeze and eyes almost popping from their sockets
each time a green sea came aboard; and whenever she took
a heavy roll, poor Ah Sam’s lower jaw sagged open and his
tongue cleaved to the roof of his mouth. Such a picture
of abject despair and utter anguish as that Chinaman, I
never saw.</p>

<p>The fourth day out the weather cleared, moderated somewhat,
and the wind shifted to the northeast, so that assisted
again by our sails, running on the starboard tack and keeping
our desired course, we made a little over five knots for a
day’s run of one hundred and thirty miles.</p>

<p>As we steamed toward Alaska, we gradually settled down
with Chipp laboring continuously to get everything properly
stowed. On deck, Ice Pilot Dunbar, Bosun Cole, and Ice
Quartermaster Nindemann were designated as watch officers,
with the seamen under them divided into two watches of
four hours each. Below in the black gang, I divided my
little force of six men into two watches of six hours each
with Machinist Lee and Fireman, 1st Class, Bartlett in charge
of the other two men comprising each watch.</p>

<p>For twenty-three days we stood on toward Unalaska
Island in the Aleutian chain, a run of about two thousand
miles from San Francisco. With better weather, our various
landsmen began to show on deck, having acquired sealegs
of a sort. Newcomb, first up, fitted out the port chartroom
as his taxidermy shop, spread his tools, and went fishing over
the side for albatross almost as soon as he was able to drag
himself out of his bunk. With a hook and a line baited with
a chunk of salt pork towing astern in the broken water of
our wake, he waited patiently but without results while an
occasional bird wheeled overhead, till at last, still wan from
retching, he turned in, leaving his hook overboard. But Newcomb,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
whom the doctor and I (chaffing him on his Yankee
accent) had nicknamed “Ninkum,” was decidedly game. It
needed no more than a call from Ambler or me on sighting
a new albatross eyeing from aloft that bit of salt pork, of</p>

<p>“Hey, Ninky, quick! Come and catch your goose!” to
bring little Newcomb, aflame with scientific ardor, tumbling
up from the poop to man his line hopefully.</p>

<p>At last an albatross measuring some seven feet in wing
spread, which for this ocean is good-sized, swooped down
and swallowed the bait, and a bedlam of cries from the anguished
bird ensued which attracted the notice of all hands.
Then came a battle, in which for a while it seemed debatable
whether the albatross, flapping its huge wings frantically
at one end of the line would come inboard, or whether little
Newcomb, not yet wholly up to par, tugging on the other
end, would go overboard to join it amongst the waves. But
Newcomb won at last, landed his bird, promptly skinned it,
and prepared it for mounting. And so much has the prosaic
power of steam already done to kill the ancient superstitions
of the sea, that this albatross, ingloriously hooked, came to its
death at the hands of a bird-stuffer without objection or
visible foreboding from any mariner aboard.</p>

<p>At last, twenty-three days out of San Francisco, with our
bunkers nearly empty from fighting head winds, and anxious
to make port before the coal gave out completely and forced
us to rely on our sails alone, we made the Aleutian Islands,
only to find them shrouded in thick fog. For Danenhower,
our navigator, trouble started immediately. The only chart
he had covering that coast was one issued thirty years before
by the Imperial Russian Hydrographic Office, and it was
quickly apparent that numberless small islands looming up
through rifts in the fog were not down on the chart at all,
while others he was looking for, were evidently incorrectly
located.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Worst of all, Danenhower could not even accurately determine
our own position, for when the sun momentarily
broke through the clouds, the horizon was obscured in mist,
and when the fog lifted enough to show the horizon, the
sun was always invisible beneath an overcast sky. For hours
on end, Danenhower haunted the bridge, clutching his sextant
whenever the horizon showed, poised like a cat before
a rat-hole, if the sun peeped out even momentarily, to pounce
upon it. But he never got his sight.</p>

<p>Between thick fogs and racing tides, with our little coal
pile getting lower and lower, we had a nerve-racking time
for two days trying to get through Aqueton Pass into Behring
Sea, the <em>Jeannette</em> anchored part of the time, underway
dead slow the remainder, nosing among the islands, often
with only the roar of breakers and the cawing of sea birds
on the rocks to give warning through the mists of the presence
of uncharted islets. Finally we slipped safely through,
and to the very evident relief of both captain and navigator,
on Saturday, August 2, dropped anchor in the harbor of
Unalaska.</p>

<p>Naturally our first concern on entering port was coal. A
brief glimpse around the land-locked harbor showed the
Alaska Fur Company’s steamer <em>St. Paul</em>, the schooner <em>St.
George</em>, owned by the same firm, and the Revenue Cutter
<em>Rush</em>, but not a sign of our coal-laden schooner, the <em>Fanny
A. Hyde</em>, nor any report of her having already passed northward
on her way to our rendezvous at St. Michael’s. So I
went ashore with Captain De Long to canvass the local fuel
situation. We found eighty tons of coal belonging to the
Navy, the remnant of a much larger lot sent north some
years before, but so deteriorated by now from long weathering
and spontaneous combustion as to be in my opinion
nearly worthless. Even so, that being all the coal there was I
was investigating the problem of getting it aboard when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
commander of the Revenue Cutter requested we leave it for
his use, because it would be his sole supply in getting back to
San Francisco in the fall. Naturally we in the <em>Jeannette</em>,
anxious to get as far north as possible before dipping into
what our consort was carrying for us, were not wholly
agreeable to waiving our claim as a naval vessel to that coal
in favor of the Revenue Service, but this difficulty was soon
adjusted by the offer of the Alaska Company’s agent to
refill our bunkers with some bituminous coal he had on hand,
his company to be reimbursed for it in New York by Mr.
Bennett. This happy solution settled our fuel question for the
moment, so while the natives took over the job of coaling
ship, I turned my attention for a few hours to making myself
acquainted with the island.</p>

<p>After nearly a month at sea, I found Unalaska pleasant
enough, with its green hills surrounding the harbor and its
small settlement, comprising mainly the houses of the Fur
Company’s agents and employees, their warehouses, and last
and perhaps most important just at this time, a Greek church.
It seems that the steamer <em>St. Paul</em>, which we found in the
harbor on our arrival Saturday, had just come down two days
before from the Pribilof Islands loaded with sealskins, and
carrying as passengers from those tiny rocks practically all
the bachelor sealers of Pribilof in search of what civilization
(in the form of metropolitan Unalaska) had to offer. All
Thursday and Friday there was great excitement here as the
native belles paraded before the eager eyes of these none too
critical prospective bridegrooms. By Saturday, most choices
were made and the Greek Catholic Church had a busy day
as the couples passed in a continuous procession before the
altar and the Russian priest tied the knots. There being no
inns or dwellings to accommodate the multitude of honeymooners,
the problem was simply enough solved by each
newly-wedded couple going directly from the church door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
for a stroll among the nearby hills. By afternoon, only some
few of the sealers, idealists undoubtedly, who were unable
to discover among the native women anyone to suit them,
were still left wandering disconsolately about the town, peering
into every female face, in a queer state of indecision
which the smiles of Unalaska’s beauties seemed unable to
resolve.</p>

<p>Between coaling ship, taking aboard furs for winter clothing,
and receiving some six tons of dried fish for dog food,
we on the <em>Jeannette</em> were kept busy for the three days of our
stay, while our nights were enlivened by the most vicious
swarms of mosquitoes it has ever been my misfortune to
encounter, and all attempts to keep them out of my bunk
with the ill-fitting bed curtains were wholly futile. My bald
spot was an especial attraction for them; in desperation I
was at last forced to sleep in my uniform cap.</p>

<p>On August 6, we hoisted anchor and got underway, with
the whole town on the waterfront to see us off amidst the
dipping of colors and a salute from three small guns in front
of the Fur Company’s office. I made out plainly enough in
the crowd the Russian priest with his immense beard, but
De Long and I differed sharply over the presence of any
of the brides amongst the throng. So far as I could judge,
there were no women there, merely a large crowd of men
waving enviously after us as we circled the harbor on our
way toward Arctic solitude.</p>

<p>With our usual luck, we bucked a head wind for all the
first day out, but to our great gratification, on the second
day the wind shifted to the southward and freshened so that
we logged the almost unbelievable day’s run of a hundred
and seventy-three miles for an hourly average of seven and
a quarter knots—for the <em>Jeannette</em> almost race horse speed!
But it was too good to last. Next day we had dropped down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
to a little under six knots, and then the breeze failed us altogether
and we finished the last three days of our run to St.
Michael’s with our useless sails furled, under steam alone at
our usual speed of four knots.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Kuro-Si-Wo Current, the “black tide” of Japan, somewhat
akin to our Gulf Stream, rises in the equatorial oceans
south of Asia, flows eastward, is partly deflected northward
by the Philippines, and then impelled by the southwest monsoons
flows at a speed reaching three knots past Japan in a
northeasterly direction, a deep blue stream some twelve degrees
warmer than the surrounding Pacific Ocean. It was a
commonly accepted belief that eastward of Kamchatka, it
separated into two branches, one flowing southward along
the west coast of North America to temper the coasts of
Alaska and British Columbia, while the second branch continued
northward through Behring Strait into the Arctic
Ocean.</p>

<p>As is well known, for several centuries most of the attempts
to reach the North Pole had gone by way of Baffin Bay
and Greenland, where without exception they were all
blocked by ice. Ours was the first expedition to make the
attempt by way of Behring Sea, De Long being willing to
test the theory that the warm waters of the Kuro-Si-Wo,
flowing northward through the Arctic Ocean, might give a
relatively ice-free channel to a high northern latitude, perhaps
even to the Pole itself; while if it did not, the shores
of Wrangel Land (of which next to nothing was yet
known), stretching northward and perhaps even crossing
the Pole to reappear in the Atlantic as Greenland as many
supposed, would offer a base in which to winter the ship
while sledge parties could work north along its coasts toward
the Pole.</p>

<p>On these two hypotheses rested mainly our choice of route.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
With the <em>Jeannette</em> in the Behring Sea at last, it remained
only to pick up our sledging outfit and put our theories
to the test. So for St. Michael’s on the mainland of Alaska
we headed, where six hundred miles to the northward of
Unalaska on the fringe of the Arctic Circle our dogs awaited
us and our rendezvous with the <em>Fanny A. Hyde</em> was to take
place.</p>

<p>The passage took us six days, and many were the discussions
round our wardroom mess table while we steamed on
through Behring Sea approaching the real north, as to the
correctness of these theories. Especially heated were the
arguments with respect to the extent of Wrangel Land
whose very existence some polar authorities doubted altogether,
since the late Russian Admiral Wrangel (for whom
it was named) in spite of a most diligent search, egged on by
native reports, never himself was able to find it. As for Kellett
and the whaler Long, who afterwards and some years
apart claimed to have seen it and even to have coasted its
southern shores, they were not everywhere believed.</p>

<p>Aside from these uncertainties, speculation waxed hot over
a secondary object of our voyage, to us an unfortunate but
unavoidable complication to our task, a search for Professor
Nordenskjöld, a Swedish explorer. Attempting that sixteenth
century dream, never yet realized, of the Northeast Passage
from Europe to the Orient via the Siberian Ocean, he had
sailed northward the year before us in the <em>Vega</em> from Stockholm
to circumnavigate Asia. Nordenskjöld, so it was reported,
had successfully reached by the winter time of 1878
Cape Serdze Kamen on the coast of Siberia only a little north
of Behring Strait, where almost in sight of his goal, he was
frozen in. Since then, except for an unverified rumor from
the natives of that occurrence, nothing further had been
heard of him or of his ship and naturally both in Sweden
and in Russia there was considerable anxiety over his fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>As a consequence, before sailing from San Francisco, we
had been ordered by the Secretary of the Navy to search
off Cape Serdze Kamen for Nordenskjöld, to assist him if
necessary, and only after assurance of his safety, to proceed
northward on our own voyage. But we were hopeful that
because of the very open summer reported at Unalaska by
whalers coming in from the north, Nordenskjöld had been
enabled to resume his voyage southward and that we should
on our arrival at St. Michael’s obtain some definite news of
his safe passage through Behring Strait, thereby obviating
the necessity of our dissipating what few weeks were left of
summer weather in searching the Siberian coasts for him
instead of striking directly for the Pole with the <em>Jeannette</em>
while the weather held.</p>

<p>So one by one, the days rolled by till on August 12 we
finally dropped our mudhook in St. Michael’s. After securing
my engines, I came on deck to find De Long turning from
the unprepossessing collection of native huts and the solitary
warehouse which made up the Alaska Company’s settlement
there, to survey gloomily the empty harbor. Here he had
confidently expected to find the <em>Fanny A. Hyde</em> waiting
with our coal, but no schooner was anywhere visible.</p>

<p>Instead of the schooner, the only boat in sight was a native
kyack from which as soon as the anchor dropped, clambered
aboard for his mail Mr. Newman, the local agent, who
had about given up hope of seeing us this year.</p>

<p>That our schooner had not arrived was evident enough
without discussion. But when De Long learned from Newman
that they had no tidings whatever of Nordenskjöld, that
they had had so far this season no communication with Siberia,
and that at St. Michael’s they knew even less of Nordenskjöld
and his whereabouts than we when we left San
Francisco, it was obvious from the droop of the skipper’s
mustaches that his depression was complete. No schooner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
no coal, and now the prospect of having to search Siberia
for Nordenskjöld instead of going north!</p>

<p>De Long, as I joined him at the rail to greet Mr. Newman,
was polishing his eyeglasses on the edge of his jacket. Meticulously
replacing them on his nose as I came up, he sourly
scanned the settlement ashore.</p>

<p>“A miserable place, Melville! Look at those dirty huts.
Only four white men and not a single white woman here,
so the agent says.” He turned to the Fur Company agent,
added prophetically, “Yet do you know, Mr. Newman, desolate
as that collection of huts there is, we may yet look back
on it as a kind of earthly paradise?”</p>

<p>Already immersed in his long delayed mail from home,
Newman nodded absent-mindedly. Apparently he was under
no illusions about life in the far north.</p>

<p>The captain shrugged his shoulders, philosophically accepted
the situation, and after some difficulty in dragging
Newman’s attention away from his letters from home, we
got down to business with the agent, which of course was
coal. It developed immediately that St. Michael’s had only
ten tons of coal, which were badly needed there for the
winter. This was hardly a surprise as we had every reason to
expect some such condition, but it settled any vague hopes
we had that we might coal and proceed before our schooner
came. We resigned ourselves to waiting for the <em>Fanny A.
Hyde</em>.</p>

<p>Next came the matter of our clothing. On that at least
was some compensation for our delay. Through Mr. Newman,
arrangements were made to send ashore all the furs we
had acquired at Unalaska and have the natives (who were
experts at it) make them up for us into parkas and other
suitable Arctic garments, instead of having each sailor of our
crew (who at best had only some rough skill with palm
and needle on heavy canvas) attempt with his clumsy fingers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
to make his own.</p>

<p>With that arranged, the while we waited for our schooner,
we settled down to making the best of St. Michael’s, all of
us, that is, except De Long, who chafing visibly at the delay,
thought up one scheme after another of expediting matters.
But each one involved ultimately burning even more coal
than waiting there, so finally the baffled skipper retired to his
cabin to await as best he could our coal-laden tender.</p>

<p>But even for the seamen, making the best of St. Michael’s
soon palled and they gave up going ashore. A liberty meant
nothing more than wandering round in the mud and the
grass, for the village had nothing more to offer a sailor. Even
liquor, the final lure of such God-forsaken ports when all else
fails, was here wholly absent, its sale being illegal in Alaska
Territory. The illegality our seamen knew about, but the
absence they refused to believe till a careful search convinced
them that the negligible communication of this spot
with civilization made it the one place in the wide world
where the laws prohibiting liquor were of necessity observed.</p>

<p>So every other distraction failing, we were thrown back
on fishing, the sailor’s last resource. Out of curiosity, we set
a seine alongside the <em>Jeannette</em>. The amount of salmon and
flounders we caught opened my eyes—we easily hauled in
enough each cast to keep the whole crew in fresh fish every
meal, till our men were so sick of the sight of fish that the
little salt pork or canned meat served out occasionally from
our stores was a welcome change. I see now why these waters
are the world’s best sealing grounds—they are literally
alive with food for the seals, which by the millions swarm
over the islands in these shallow seas. The steamer <em>St. Paul</em>
which we had fallen in with at Unalaska on her way back
to America, had her hold packed solid with sealskins, one
hundred thousand of them in that vessel alone, a treasure
ship indeed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>While the sailors fished, we in the wardroom cast about
in various ways for diversion. Newcomb (whom privately
the captain was already beginning to regret having brought
along, for not only did Newcomb seem never to have grown
up but it was now too late to hope that he ever would) went
into business for himself. Reverting to the habits of his forbears
in far-off Salem, he went ashore with a five dollar bill,
purchased from the Alaska Company’s store a variety of
needles, thread, and similar notions, carted them a mile or
two up the coast well out of sight of St. Michael’s, set up
a “Trading Post,” and proceeded to sell his wares to the innocent
Indians at just twice what the company store was asking
for them.</p>

<p>For this piece of sharp practice at the expense of the natives
who were helpfully engaged in making up our fur
clothing, gleefully related to the wardroom mess on his
return aboard, Newcomb earned the immediate contempt of
his fellow New Englander, Dunbar, who burst out,</p>

<p>“You damned Yankee pedlar!” And from that day on, our
ice-pilot who himself hailed from the land of the wooden
nutmegs and was therefore perhaps touchy of making New
England’s reputation any worse, refused again to speak to
Newcomb, though some of the rest of us, including myself,
felt with Newcomb that there was at least some humor in
the situation.</p>

<p>Tiring of fish and of St. Michael’s, I organized a duck-hunting
party with Dr. Ambler, Dunbar and Collins for my
companions. For a while, I hesitated over including Collins,
for by now I had discovered he also had a serious flaw in his
character—his sole idea of humor was getting off puns, and so
far all the attempts of his shipmates in the wardroom to cure
him of it had failed. But as Collins was also our best hand
with a shotgun, I decided to stand the puns for a few hours
on the chance of increasing our bag of game and asked him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
to go.</p>

<p>We purposely took a tent and camped ashore all night to
be ready for the ducks at dawn. We got about a dozen
(Collins knocked down most of them) but without blinds
to work from or decoys to attract our game, it was a tough
job and we tramped a long way along the marshy beaches
looking for game. During this search we separated, and I
with my shotgun at “ready” was scanning the beach for
ducks just below a small bluff, when suddenly there came
sliding down its precipitous slope on all fours, face first with
hands and feet spread out in the mud in a ludicrous attempt
to stop himself, our meteorologist, Collins!</p>

<p>The spectacle was so comical that unthinkingly I roared
out to Ambler,</p>

<p>“Look at the old cow there, sliding down the hill!” but
I soon enough regretted my outburst for it was evident that
Collins, plastered with mud from his mishap and in no humor
to see anything funny in his antics, was furious and took
my remark as a deep personal insult. So all in all, my hunting
party was no great success, and by the time I signalled our
cutter to stand in and pick us up, we were all so stiff from
sleeping on the hard ground, so throbbing in every muscle
from our tramp, and so sullenly did Collins keep eyeing me,
that I began to doubt whether a dozen ducks were worth it.</p>

<p>Dr. Ambler, lolling back on the cushions in the sternsheets
of the cutter, homeward bound, apparently took a similar
view.</p>

<p>“About once a year of this satisfies me completely, chief.”
He paused, ruefully massaged his aching calves, then in his
careful professional manner continued, “As a doctor, I’m
convinced that man’s an animal that must take to hard work
gradually. No more plunging headlong into it for me! I prescribe
a day’s complete rest in our berths for all hands here
the minute we hit the ship!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>The doctor, I believe, followed his own prescription, and
perhaps Collins and Dunbar did too, but I didn’t have time.
We had broken a pump-rod on our way to Alaska, temporarily
stopping our boiler feed. In that emergency, the spare
auxiliary I had installed at Mare Island was immediately cut
in on the feed line, saving us from hauling fires and going
back to sail alone, but it left us with no reserve pump and it
was up to me somehow to provide another rod. Neither
Unalaska nor St. Michael’s could help me in the least—a
machine shop in those primitive trading posts had never even
been dreamed of.</p>

<p>With the help of Lee, who was a machinist, and of Bartlett,
fireman, first class, I now set about supplying a new pump-rod
from our own resources. While at Mare Island, in view
of the uncertainty of repair faculties in the Arctic, like prudent
engineers we had acquired for the <em>Jeannette</em> quite a set
of tools. I won’t exactly say we stole them, for after all they
merely moved from one spot owned by Uncle Sam to another
also under his jurisdiction, but at any rate, in good
old Navy fashion during our stay at the Navy Yard everything
not nailed down in the machine shop there that appealed
to us and that we could carry, somehow moved aboard
the <em>Jeannette</em>, and now all our recent acquisitions came in
handy. I rigged up a long lathe. Out of some square stock
once intended by the Navy Yard for forging out chain plates
for the <em>Mohican</em>, we turned out a very favorable replica
in iron of our broken rod, squared off the shoulders for the
pistons, cut the threads for the retaining nuts, and long before
the schooner showed up in port, had the disabled pump
reassembled with the new rod and banging lustily away on
the line once more, hammering feed water into our steaming
boiler, thus making good my promise to the captain when
the old rod broke. This particularly pleased De Long, who
I am afraid, like most Line officers, underestimating the resourcefulness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
of Navy engineers and particularly Scotch
ones, had been fearful that we might have to turn back or
at least take a long delay while we awaited the arrival, on the
<em>St. Paul’s</em> return trip, of a new rod from the United States.</p>

<p>For six days we waited in St. Michael’s, eyes glued to the
harbor entrance, undergoing as the captain feelingly expressed
it that “hope deferred which maketh the heart sick,”
when at last on August 18 the <em>Fanny A. Hyde</em> showed up,
beating her way closehauled into the harbor. She was a welcome
sight not only to our careworn skipper but to all of
us, who long before had completely exhausted in a couple
of hours the possibilities of St. Michael’s, and in our then
state of ignorance, were eager to move on into the even more
barren Arctic.</p>

<p>In fact, so eager were we to be on our way that the captain
signalled the schooner not to anchor at all but to come
alongside us directly, prepared immediately for coaling.</p>

<p>The next three days were busy ones for all hands, lightering
coal in bags up from the schooner’s holds, dumping it
through the deck scuttles into our bunkers, and there trimming
it high up under the deck beams to take advantage
of every last cubic inch of the <em>Jeannette’s</em> stowage space.
Most of this work of muling the coal around we had to do
with our own force, for the schooner with a crew of six men
only and being a sailing vessel, with no power machinery
of any kind, could assist us but little. Here our deck winch,
made of those old steam launch engines which I had fitted
aboard at Mare Island, came in very handy in saving our
backs, for with falls rigged from the yardarms by our energetic
Irish bosun, I soon had the niggerheads on that winch
whipping the bags of coal up out of the schooner’s holds
and dropping them down on our decks in grand style.</p>

<p>Needless to say, however, with coal littering our decks and
coal dust everywhere, with staterooms and cabins tightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
sealed up to prevent its infiltration, and with our whole crew
as black as nigger minstrels, we carefully abstained from taking
aboard any other stores and least of all our furs or dogs
from ashore, till coaling was completed and the ship washed
down.</p>

<p>At this coaling we labored steadily until late on the twentieth
of August when checking the coal we had already
transferred and what was left aboard the schooner, I came
to the conclusion that there would still be twenty tons remaining
on the <em>Fanny A. Hyde</em> for which we could find no
stowage, even on our decks, and entering the captain’s cabin,
I suggested to him that instead of dismissing our escort at
St. Michael’s as intended, he take a chance and order her
to follow us on our next leg, the three hundred mile journey
across Norton Sound and Behring Strait to St. Lawrence Bay
in Siberia, where that last twenty tons of coal she carried,
which otherwise would go back to the United States, would
just about replenish what we burned on the way over to
Asia.</p>

<p>To put it mildly, when I sprang this suggestion on him
De Long greeted it with a cheer, but he went me one better.</p>

<p>“That twenty tons she’ll certainly carry along for us, chief,
but that’s not all! What’s left in her now, and how long’ll it
take you to get her down to that last twenty tons?”</p>

<p>“She’s got fifty tons still aboard her, captain,” I answered.
I looked at my watch. It was getting along toward evening
already. “But the last thirty tons which we can take aboard
from her, will go almighty slow! Trimming it down inside
those stifling bunkers to top ’em off for a full due is the
devil’s own job—it’ll take us all day tomorrow certainly!”</p>

<p>De Long, who, downcast over the non-arrival of the
schooner, had not cracked a smile for a week, now stroked
his long mustaches gleefully.</p>

<p>“Fine, chief! Pass the word to Lieutenant Chipp to belay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
any more coaling. He’s to knock off immediately and start
washing down. Here’s where we get back one of those lost
days, anyway.” De Long regarded me with positive cheerfulness.
“We’ll sail tomorrow! If the <em>Fanny Hyde’s</em> going
to carry twenty tons for us to Siberia, she might as well carry
the whole fifty that’s still aboard her! So instead of coaling
here any more, we’ll quit right now, swing ship in the morning
to check our compasses, then load furs, stores, and dogs
in the afternoon, and sail tomorrow night from this God-forsaken
hole! How’ll that suit you, chief?”</p>

<p>“Brother, full ahead on that!” I exclaimed. “You’ll never
get St. Michael’s hull down any too soon for me!”</p>

<p>So to the intense relief of the crew, Jack Cole was soon
piping down coaling gear. The schooner cast loose, shoved
off, and anchored clear, and as darkness fell the hoses were
playing everywhere over the <em>Jeannette’s</em> topsides, washing
down, while from every scupper a black stream poured into
the clear waters of the bay, as a welcome by-product effectively
putting an end to any more fishing in our vicinity.</p>

<p>Our last day at St. Michael’s was perhaps our busiest.</p>

<p>In the morning, steaming slowly round the harbor, we
swung ship for compass deviations, with Danenhower hunching
his burly shoulders constantly over the binnacle while
Chipp at the pelorus took bearings of the sun. By noon this
essential task was completed and we anchored again, commencing
immediately after mess gear was stowed to receive
stores from ashore.</p>

<p>The display of furs we received, made up now into clothing,
of seal, mink, beaver, deer, wolf, Arctic squirrel, and fox,
all to be worn by rough seamen, would have caused pangs
of jealousy among the ladies on Fifth Avenue, who would
have lingered long over each sleek garment, lovingly caressing
its velvety softness. But instead of that, disregarded by
everyone in our haste, down the hatch shot our furs, our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
only concern being to get them aboard and weigh anchor.</p>

<p>Following the clothing came aboard assorted cargo—forty
Eskimo dogs, five dog sleds, forty sets of dog harness, four
dozen pairs of snowshoes, sixty-nine pairs of sealskin boots,
ton after ton of compressed fish for dog food, three small
Eskimo skin boats called baideras, and numberless odds and
ends; while to top off all, as a personal gift Mr. Newman
insisted on presenting to the captain a very handsomely silver-mounted
Winchester repeating rifle and eight hundred rounds
of ammunition for it.</p>

<p>Last but not least important, came aboard some new members
of our crew, two Alaskan Indians from St. Michael’s.
This pair, Alexey and Aneguin, carefully selected on the
recommendation of the entire white population of St.
Michael’s (all four of them), were after a lengthy pow-wow
over terms with the headman of the native village shipped
as hunters and dog-drivers. Alexey, as senior hunter, was to
be paid twenty dollars a month; Aneguin, his assistant, as
a hunter’s mate (to put it in nautical parlance) was to receive
fifteen; and each was to draw from the company store
an outfit worth fifty dollars to start with and on discharge
to receive a Winchester rifle and 1000 cartridges. To the
wife of Alexey and to the mother of Aneguin, thus deprived
of their support, were to be issued at the <em>Jeannette’s</em> expense
from the Alaska Company’s store, provisions to the value of
five dollars each monthly until their men should finally be
returned to St. Michael’s.</p>

<p>These terms being finally settled to the satisfaction of all,
Alexey and Aneguin reported aboard at 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, both for the
first time in their lives dressed in “store clothes” which they
had just drawn from Mr. Newman’s stock, and proud as peacocks
in shiny black Russian hats, topped with flaming red
bands. Alexey (who to the best of my knowledge, aside
from our captain, was the only married man aboard) was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
accompanied by his Indian wife, a small, shy, pretty woman
in furs oddly contrasting with her husband’s stiffly worn
civilized raiment, and by his little boy. Tightly holding each
other’s hands, this tiny Alaskan group drifted wonderingly
over the ship, children all in their open-mouthed curiosity;
while Aneguin, accompanied by his chief and a delegation
of natives come to see him off, was just as naive in exclaiming
over everything he saw, and the excitement of all reached
a high pitch when Captain De Long presented to Alexey’s
shrinking little wife a china cup and saucer with “U.S.N.”
in gold on it, and to her little boy, a harmonica.</p>

<p>As evening drew on and the hour for departure approached,
Alexey and his wife, seated on a sea chest on the
poop, clung silently to each other, till at the hoarse call of
the bosun, “All visitors ashore!” accompanied by significant
gestures toward the rail, they parted affectionately—and
forever.</p>

<p>For a few minutes there was a grand scramble of Indians
over our bulwarks into native boats. Then to the rattling of
the chain links in the hawsepipe, our cable came slowly in
and with a blast of our whistle in salute, we got underway
for St. Lawrence Bay, on the Siberian side of Behring Sea.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Through a light breeze and a smooth sea we steamed out
in the darkness. The <em>Fanny A. Hyde</em>, ordered to follow us
at dawn, we expected to reach port in Siberia even ahead of
our own arrival since she was now very light while we,
heavily laden once more, were nearly awash.</p>

<p>A new note in seagoing came into our lives upon departing
from St. Michael’s—our forty dogs. They quickly proved
to be the damnedest nuisances ever seen aboard ship, roaming
the deck in carefree fashion, snarling and fighting among
themselves every five minutes, and unless one was armed with
a belaying pin in each hand, it was nearly suicide to enter a
pack of the howling brutes to stop them. They fought for
pure enjoyment so it seemed to me, immune almost from any
harm, for their fur was so thick and tangled, they got nothing
but mouthfuls of hair from snapping at each other. In
spite of fairly continual fighting, we got the ship along for
after all my engines drove her on, but how we should ever
fare under sail alone I wondered, unless each seaman soon
got the knack of disregarding half a dozen pseudo-wolves
leaping at him each time he rushed to ease a sheet or to
belay a halliard or a brace. Meanwhile we let the dogs severely
alone, it being the duty of Aneguin and Alexey to
feed and water them, and apparently also to beat them well
so that their fighting was not one continuous performance.</p>

<p>We had expected to make the three hundred miles across
Behring Sea to St. Lawrence Bay in Siberia in two and a
half days, but we did not. Our second day out, the wind
freshened, there was a decided swell from the northward,
and all in all the weather had a very unsettled look. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
most of our sail set, we logged five knots during the morning,
but as the seas picked up, the ship began to pitch heavily, and
in the early afternoon a green sea came aboard that carried
away both our forward water-closets, fortunately empty at
the time. At this mishap, we furled most of our canvas and
slowed the engines to thirty revolutions, greatly easing the
motion.</p>

<p>But as the night drew on it became evident we were in
for it. The ocean hereabouts is so shallow that an ugly sea
quickly kicks up under even a fresh breeze, and we were
soon up against a full gale, not a pleasing prospect for a
grossly overloaded ship. There was nothing for it, however,
except to heave to, head to the wind, and ride it out under
stormsails only. Accordingly in the first dog watch, I banked
fires, stopped the engines, and the <em>Jeannette</em> lay to on the
starboard tack under the scantiest canvas we dared carry—stormsail,
fore and aft sail, and spanker only, all reefed down
to the very last row of reef-points.</p>

<p>For thirty hours while the gale howled, we rode it out
thus, the overloaded <em>Jeannette</em> groaning and creaking, submerged
half the time, with confused seas coming aboard in
all directions. Every hatch on deck was tightly battened
down; otherwise solid water, often standing two and three
feet deep on our decks, would have quickly poured below
to destroy our slight buoyancy and sink us like a rock.</p>

<p>But even so, in spite of lying to, we took a terrific battering,
and time after time as we plunged into a green sea, it
seemed beyond belief that our overloaded hull should still
remain afloat.</p>

<p>In the middle of this storm, worn from a night of watchfulness,
with Chipp on the bridge temporarily as his relief,
Captain De Long sat dozing in his cabin chair, not daring
even to crawl into his bunk lest he lose a second in responding
to any call. Suddenly a solid sea came over the side, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
a wild roar broke on board, and in a rushing wall of water
carrying all before it, hit the poop bulkhead, smashed in
the windows to the captain’s stateroom, and in an instant
flooded the room. Our startled skipper coming out of his
doze found himself swimming for his life in his own cabin,
all his belongings afloat in a tangle about him!</p>

<p>For the first hour of that gale, the howling of our forty
Eskimo dogs was a fair rival to the howling of the wind
through the rigging, but as the waves began to break aboard,
the poor dogs, half-drowned, quieted to a piteous whimper,
and with their tails between their legs, sought shelter from
the rushing seas in the lee of the galley, the bulwarks, the
hatch coamings even—anything that would save them from
the impact of those swirling waves. For once there was no
fighting, each dog being solely absorbed in keeping his nose
above water, and when possible on that heaving deck, in
keeping his claws dug into the planking to save himself from
being flung headlong into the lee scuppers.</p>

<p>But the gale finally blew itself out, and thankfully spreading
our reefed canvas, we arrived four days out of St. Michael’s
in lonely St. Lawrence Bay, to find the little <em>Jeannette</em>,
a tiny symbol of civilization, dwarfed in that vast solitude
by snow-capped mountains rising precipitously from the water,
a magnificent spectacle of nature in her grandest mood.</p>

<p>But our isolation was broken soon enough by two large
baideras which pushed out to meet us, crowded with natives
who without leave clambered over our rails, eagerly
offering in broken English to engage themselves as whalers,
which naturally enough they assumed was the purpose of our
cruise.</p>

<p>But we welcomed them gladly enough for another reason.
What did they know of Nordenskjöld?</p>

<p>From their chief, a tall, brawny fellow calling himself
“George,” after much cross-examination De Long elicited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
the information that a steamer, smaller even than the <em>Jeannette</em>,
had been there apparently three months before, and
that during the previous winter he, Chief George, had on a
journey across East Cape to Koliutchin Bay on the north
coast of Siberia, seen the same ship frozen in the ice there.
This seemed to check with our last news on Nordenskjöld’s
<em>Vega</em>. If indeed she had reached St. Lawrence Bay and passed
south, she was of course safe now and we need no longer
concern ourselves. But was it really the <em>Vega</em>?</p>

<p>Patiently, like a skilled lawyer examining an ignorant witness,
De Long worked on George to find that out. Who was
the <em>Vega’s</em> captain? An old man with a white beard who
spoke no English. Who then had George conversed with?
Another officer, a Russian, who spoke their tongue, the
Tchuchee dialect, like a native. Who was he? On this point,
George, uncertain over nearly everything else, was absolutely
positive, and answered proudly,</p>

<p>“He name Horpish.”</p>

<p>But to De Long’s great disappointment, on consulting the
muster roll of the <em>Vega</em> with which we had been furnished,
no “Horpish” appeared thereon. Again and again, Chipp, De
Long, and I pored over that list of the Swedish, Danish, and
Russian names of the men and officers accompanying Nordenskjöld,
while George, leaning over our shoulders, repeated
over and over, “Horpish, he Horpish,” obviously disgusted
at our inability to understand our own language.</p>

<p>Finally De Long put his finger on the answer. There, a few
lines down from Nordenskjöld on that list was the man we
were looking for—</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Nordquist, Imperial Russian Navy.”</p>

<p>I pronounced it a few times—Nordquist, Horpish—yes, it
must be he. Phonetically in Tchuchee that was a good match
for Nordquist.</p>

<p>And this was all we learned. The steamer, whatever her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
name, had stayed only one day, then departed to the southward,
loaded according to George with “plenty coals.”</p>

<p>With some bread and canned meat in return for this
sketchy information, we eased George and his followers,
greatly disappointed at not being signed on as whalers, over
the side before we lost anything. For while these Tchuchees
appeared dirty, lazy, and utterly worthless, their unusual size
made them potentially dangerous enemies when in force, and
we posted an armed watch on deck as a precaution.</p>

<p>Our schooner arrived soon after we did, and we finished
hoisting out of her all the coal down to the last lump, ending
up with 132 tons stowed in our bunkers, which was their
total capacity, and with 28 tons more as a deckload, giving
us a total of 160 tons with which to start into the Arctic,
nearly twice the amount of coal the <em>Jeannette</em> was originally
designed to carry.</p>

<p>On August 27 we finished coaling and steamed out towing
the schooner astern of us, for it seemed unsafe with her little
crew of only six to leave her to get underway in desolate
St. Lawrence Bay amidst that ugly-looking crowd of brawny
Tchuchees, all experts at handling harpoons and looking
none too scrupulous over what they chose to hurl them at.</p>

<p>Once clear of the harbor, we headed north for Cape East,
while the lightened <em>Fanny A. Hyde</em>, carrying now as cargo
only the last mail we ever sent back, spread her sails and
with (for her but not for us) a fair wind was soon hull down
to the southward, our last link with home finally severed.</p>

<p>Steaming steadily into a strong head wind, we stood on
through Behring Strait and during the night passed between
East Cape and the Diomede Islands, three barren rocks jutting
from the sea, forming stepping stones almost between
the continents of Asia and America, over which may very
well have passed ages ago that immigration at the time of the
dispersion of the human race which brought man first to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
North and then to South America.</p>

<p>But this human migration of former ages, even if so, interested
us little in comparison with what the migratory waters
of the ocean might be doing now. At the captain’s orders,
Collins prepared a set of thermometers and dropped them
overboard strung out on a line. If the Kuro-Si-Wo Current
actually flowed northward into the Arctic Sea as we hoped,
through this narrow funnel it must pass, and as we steamed
slowly northward through the strait, Collins periodically read
the thermometers to get the temperatures at varying depths,
while Newcomb tended a dredge towed astern to obtain
samples of the marine life at the bottom.</p>

<p>To our keen chagrin, the most that could be said for the
results of our observations was that they were neutral—they
proved or disproved nothing. The water was about the same
in temperature from top to bottom and did not differ appreciably
from the temperature of the air, a result which
certainly did not indicate the presence of any marked warm
current thereabouts. But then on the other hand, as we passed
through, the fresh breeze we encountered from the northwest,
blowing down through the strait, might well on that
day have upset or even reversed the normal flow of water
in a channel only twenty-eight fathoms deep. The thermometers
proved nothing. How about the dredge? Eagerly
we awaited a report from Newcomb with respect to his examination
of its contents. Were the specimens in any degree
symptomatic of the tropical waters of the Kuro-Si-Wo
Current?</p>

<p>But there also we got scant comfort. The catch in the
dredge was nondescript, and no deductions could safely be
drawn. If the Kuro-Si-Wo Current on which we were banking
so heavily for the success of our expedition flowed into
the polar seas, at least we found no evidence of it.</p>

<p>As the day dawned with the empty horizon widening out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
before us to the north, we found ourselves at last in the
Arctic Ocean, our gateway to the Pole. We stood to the
northwest with somewhat overcast skies, coasting along the
northern shores of Siberia before striking off for Wrangel
Land, our thorough-going captain determined to steam a
little out of his way to make one more stop at Cape Serdze
Kamen to check Chief George’s story of the <em>Vega’s</em> actually
having been there and left.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon, we made out a headland on our port
hand, which the vigilant Danenhower, fortunately able just
then to catch a sight of the sun to establish our position,
pronounced as the desired cape. We stood in and anchored,
but with steam up ready for getting underway instantly,
since we were on a lee shore with none too good a holding
ground.</p>

<p>After supper, the starboard whaleboat was cleared away and
lowered, and the captain, backed up by Chipp, Dunbar, Collins
and Alexey, started in for a collection of native houses
on the beach to investigate about the <em>Vega</em>. But when they
approached the shore, they found such a heavy sea rolling
over a rapidly moving fringe of pack ice that the whaleboat’s
efforts to get through were wholly ineffectual and after
half an hour were abandoned when it was observed that the
natives were getting ready to come out themselves in a skin
boat.</p>

<p>Led by their chief in a bright red tunic, these latter, better
acquainted with the coast than we, managed to make passage
through the ice into the open water off shore, where they
followed the whaleboat back to our ship and then over the
side into the <em>Jeannette’s</em> cabin.</p>

<p>But there, in spite of Alexey’s best efforts with native dialects
on the chief, who had all the dignity of a king, we were
unable to make our questions about Nordenskjöld understood,
or get anything understandable out of him except the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
one word,</p>

<p>“Schnapps?”</p>

<p>But to this De Long shook his head. He was too well acquainted
with the results to pass fire-water out to natives.
So with this we were stalled till the natives pushed forth a
decrepit old squaw, who once an inhabitant of Kings Island,
apparently had recognized Alexey’s dialect. But even on her,
neither the name of Nordenskjöld nor of the <em>Vega</em> made any
impression till Alexey, remembering Chief George’s reference
to the Russian officer who spoke Tchuchee, mentioned
Lieutenant Nordquist.</p>

<p>Immediately the squaw became all animation and her face
lighted with understanding.</p>

<p>“Horpish?” She nodded her head vigorously and from then
on, all was plain sailing. Alexey had difficulty in getting in
a word sideways, “Horpish” had made such an impression.
“Horpish’s” ship had been there a day, coming from a little
further west in Koliutchin Bay, where she had wintered, a
fact very soon verified by Chipp, who going ashore to visit
that spot, came back with a miscellaneous collection of articles—Swedish
coins, buttons from Russian, Danish, and
Swedish uniforms, and prized most of all by the natives and
hardest to get from them, a number of empty tin cans!</p>

<p>This evidence settled conclusively our search for Nordenskjöld
and the <em>Vega</em>. Undoubtedly she had been at Cape
Serdze Kamen as rumored; she had passed undamaged
through Behring Strait, and must now be on her way southward
through the Pacific to Japan, if indeed she had not
already arrived there. We need no longer concern ourselves
over Nordenskjöld and his crew, their safety was assured.</p>

<p>So on the last day of August, we hoisted in our whaleboat
and stood out to the northward. It being Sunday, at 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
we rigged ship for church in the cabin, and our captain, a
devoutly religious man, held Divine Service, attended by all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the crew save those on watch.</p>

<p>With heads bowed, we stood while our ship steamed away
from that bleak coast, our anchor hoisted in for the last time,
with our thoughts divided between Nordenskjöld safely
homeward bound and ourselves headed at last into the unknown
polar seas.</p>

<p>As Collins rolled the notes solemnly out from the little
organ and the rough voices of our sailors echoed the words,
never before had I seen men at sea so deeply stirred by that
heartfelt appeal,</p>

<p class="no-indent">For the first time, ice now began to be a factor in our cruise.
We had noted a little along the Siberian shore churned by
the surf when the whaleboat attempted a landing off Serdze
Kamen, but now as we stood away from the coast, pack ice
to the westward making out from Koliutchin Bay bothered
the ship noticeably, with loose ice in large chunks bobbing
about in the waves, necessitating constant conning by the
officer of the watch to avoid trouble. Finally at 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, with
ice growing heavier, while our course to Wrangel Land lay
N.W. by N., the captain changed course to N.E. for a few
hours to take her out of it, and then having come to open
water, back to N.W., on which course under sail and steam
we stood on through the night and all next day with beautifully
clear cold weather attending us.</p>

<p>About a hundred miles to the southward of where Wrangel
Land should be, we made out the ice pack once more,
extending this time from dead ahead uninterruptedly around
to the westward as far as eye could see. Confronted thus by
the solid pack across our path, there was nothing for it but
to head the <em>Jeannette</em> off to the eastward, away from our
objective, skirting as closely as we dared that pack on our
port side, solid ice now seven feet thick!</p>

<p>Meantime a fine southeast breeze sprang up and to this we
made all sail, heading northeast with wind abeam and the ice
dead to leeward, while from the crow’s-nest, grizzled old
Dunbar, our ex-whaler ice-pilot, closely scanned the pack for
any lead of open water through it going northward, but he
found not the slightest sign of one.</p>

<p>On that course we were constantly increasing our distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
from Wrangel Land instead of diminishing it, so De Long
after morosely regarding for some time the fine wake which
our six-knot speed was churning up in the icy water astern,
finally ordered me when darkness fell to stop the engines,
bank fires, and save the coal, letting her go under sail alone
for the night.</p>

<p>Late in the first watch then, the engines were secured, the
fires heavily banked in the boilers to burn as little coal as
possible, and stocky Bartlett, fireman in charge of the watch,
instructed to keep them so. With all secured below I came
up on deck, for a few minutes before turning in looking
off to leeward across the black water at the vague loom of
that solid ice pack fringing the near horizon.</p>

<p>Eight bells struck, the watch was changed, the men relieved
tumbling below to the forecastle with great alacrity
for in spite of the southeast breeze, there was a sharp chill
in the cutting wind as the <em>Jeannette</em>, with all sails drawing,
plunged ahead at full speed. Deeply laden and well heeled
over by a stiff beam wind, we were running with the lee
scuppers awash, and the cold sea threatened momentarily to
flood over our low bulwark. What with the icy water and
the chilly air, the contrast with the warmth of the boiler
room I had just left was too much for me. With a final
glance overhead at our straining cordage and taut canvas
and a wave to Dunbar who with dripping whiskers dimly
visible in the binnacle light on the bridge above me, had
just taken over the watch on deck, I ducked aft into the
poop and wearily slid into my bunk.</p>

<p>On the starboard tack with the wind freshening, the <em>Jeannette</em>
stood on through the night. One bell struck. In the
perfunctory routine drone of the sea, the lookout reported
the running lights burning bright and the report was gravely
acknowledged by Mr. Dunbar, though we might just as well
have saved our lamp oil, for what ship was there besides ourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
in that vast polar solitude to whom those lights, steadily
burning in the darkness, might mean anything in the way
of warning?</p>

<p>Nevertheless we were underway. Habit and the law of the
sea are strong, so on deck the incongruity of the reports
struck no one. Hans Erichsen, a huge Dane posted in the bow
as lookout, turned his eyes lazily from the gleaming lights in
the rigging toward the bowsprit once more, gradually accustoming
them again to the darkness ahead.</p>

<p>And then hoarse and loud, nothing perfunctory this time
about the call, came Erichsen’s cry,</p>

<p>“Ice ho! Dead ahead and on the weather bow!”</p>

<p>On the silent <em>Jeannette</em>, that cry, cutting through the whistling
of the wind and the creaking of the rigging, echoed
aft in the poop to bring up in the twinkling of an eye, tumbling
half clad out of their bunks, Captain De Long, Mr.
Chipp, and all the other officers.</p>

<p>“Hard alee!” roared Dunbar to the helmsman, desperately
endeavoring to bring her into the wind to avoid a collision,
for with ice alee, ahead, on the weather bow, there was no
way out except to tack.</p>

<p>But the <em>Jeannette</em>, heavily laden and with a trim by the
stern as she then was, had never successfully come about except
with the help of her engines. And now the fires were
banked! But she must tack or crash!</p>

<p>“All hands!”</p>

<p>Through the darkness echoed the rush of feet tumbling
up from the forecastle, racing to man sheets and braces, the
shrill piping of the bosun, hoarse orders, then a bedlam of
curses and the howling of dogs as all over the deck, men and
animals collided in the night.</p>

<p>In response to her hard over rudder, the <em>Jeannette’s</em> bow
swung slowly to starboard while from ahead, plainly audible
now on our deck, came the roar of the waves breaking high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
on the solid pack.</p>

<p>Would she answer her helm and tack?</p>

<p>Breathlessly we waited while with jibs and headsails eased
and spanker hauled flat aft, the <em>Jeannette</em> rounded sluggishly
toward the wind and the open sea and away from that
terrible ice.</p>

<p>Then she stopped swinging, hung “in irons.” With our useless
sails flapping wildly and no steam to save us, helplessly
we watched with eyes straining through the darkness as the
<em>Jeannette</em> drove broadside to leeward, straight for the ice
pack!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">We struck with a shivering crash that shook the <em>Jeannette</em>
from keel to main truck, and hung there with yards banging
violently. Lucky for us now, that nineteen inch thickness
of heavily reenforced side and the stout backing of those new
trusses below—that impact would have stove in the side of
any ordinary vessel!</p>

<p>But though we had survived that first smashing blow, we
were in grave danger. Impotent with sails and rudder to claw
off that ice bank, we lay there in a heavy seaway, rolling
and grinding against the jagged shelf on which the wind was
pushing us.</p>

<p>That put it up to the black gang. I rushed below into the
fireroom.</p>

<p>“Bartlett!” I yelled. “Wide open on your dampers! Accelerate
that draft!”</p>

<p>“Sharvell! Iversen!” I sang out sharply to my two coalheavers.
“Lively with the slice bars! Cut those banked fires
to pieces! Get ’em blazing!”</p>

<p>For thirty anxious minutes we fought before our two
Scotch boilers with slice bars, rakes, and shovels to raise
steam, while through our solid sides as we toiled below the
water line, we heard the groaning and the crunching of the
ice digging into our planking and from above the slapping
of the sails, the howling of the dogs, and the kicks and curses
of the seamen still struggling futilely to get the ship to claw
off to windward.</p>

<p>At last with fires roaring, the needle of our pressure gauge
started to climb toward the popping point; I reported we
were ready with the engines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>De Long doused all sail; under steam alone with our helm
hard aport and propeller turning over at half speed, we
swung our bow at last to starboard into the wind and slowly
eased away from the pack, decidedly thankful to get clear
with no more damage than a terrible gouging of our stout
elm planking. And under steam alone for the rest of the
night we stood on dead slow nearly to windward between
east and southeast, keeping that ice pack a respectable distance
on our port hand till dawn came and with it, a fog!</p>

<p>For the next few watches, we played tag with the ice-fields,
standing off when the fog came in, standing in when
the fog lifted, searching for an open lead to the northward.
At one time during this period, the fog thinned to show to
our intense astonishment, off to the southeast a bark under
full sail, a whaler undoubtedly, standing wisely enough to
the southward away from the ice, but so far off, anxious as
we were not to lose any northing while we sought an open
lead, we never ran down and spoke him.</p>

<p>Soon, a little regretfully, we lost him in the fog, the last
vessel we ever saw, homeward bound no doubt and a missed
opportunity for us to send a farewell message home before
we entered the ice-pack around Wrangel Land.</p>

<p>Finally with nothing but ice in sight except to the southeast,
De Long decided to try a likely looking lead opening
to leeward, toward the northwest. So with the captain in
the crow’s-nest and the ice-pilot perched on the topsail yard,
we entered the lead, Lieutenant Chipp on the bridge conning
the ship as directed from aloft. Cautiously we proceeded in
a general northwesterly direction up that none too wide
lead of water with broken ice-fields fairly close aboard us
now on both sides, for some seven hours till late afternoon,
when simultaneously the lead suddenly narrowed and the fog
thickened so much that we stopped, banked fires, and put
out an ice-anchor to a nearby floe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Chilled, cramped, and dead-tired from his long day in the
crow’s-nest, De Long laid down from aloft and promptly
crawled into his bunk, while the fog continuing, we lay to
our ice-anchor till next day.</p>

<p>For the first time on our cruise, the temperature that night
dropped below freezing, with the odd result that by morning
between the fog and the freezing weather, our rigging was
a mass of shimmering snow and frost, magically turning the
<em>Jeannette</em> into a fairy ship, a lovely sight with her every
stay and shroud shining and sparkling in the early dawn, and
the running rigging a swaying crystal web of jewels glistening
against the sky.</p>

<p>But as the fog still hung on, and we consequently could
not move, I am afraid our captain, more interested in progress
northward than in beauty, gave scant heed, and it was
left to Ambler and me, being early on deck, really to drink
in the soul-satisfying loveliness of that scene.</p>

<p>Some new ice, a thin film only, made around the ship
during the night, the weather being calm and the surface
of our lead therefore undisturbed and free to freeze, but it
was insignificant in thickness compared to the pack ice surrounding
us, which seemed everywhere to be at least seven
feet in depth, of which thickness some two feet were above
water and the rest below, with some hummocks here and
there pushed up above the smooth pack to a height of six
feet perhaps.</p>

<p>By afternoon, the fog cleared enough for us to haul in our
ice-anchor, spread fires and get underway along our lead,
which running now in a northeasterly direction we followed
for two hours, poking and ramming our way between drifting
floes. Then to our delighted surprise, we emerged into
the open sea again, open, that is, between east and north
only, with ice filling the horizon in all other directions.</p>

<p>With some searoom to work in, we speeded the engines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
and headed north, where we soon passed a drifting tree, torn
up by the roots, an odd bit of flotsam to encounter in those
waters, but which as it must have come from the south encouraged
us since it lent some weight, however slight, to
the Japanese Current theory about which we were beginning
to entertain serious doubts. But we had little time to speculate
on this, for soon from the lookout came the cry,</p>

<p>“Land ho!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, bearing northwest, apparently forty miles
off and much distorted by mirage, was land which from our
position and its bearings we judged to be Herald Island. This
island I must hasten to explain was so named, not after the
<em>New York Herald</em> whose owner, Mr. Bennett, was financing
our expedition, but after H.M.S. <em>Herald</em>, whose captain, Kellett,
had discovered and landed on that island thirty years
before, in 1849.</p>

<p>Immediately from alow and aloft all hands were scanning
the island, through binoculars, through telescopes, and with
the naked eye. There was much animated discussion among
us as to its distance, but regardless of that we could do nothing
to close on it, for the ice-field lay between. So as night
fell, we merely steamed in circles at dead slow speed, just
clear of the pack.</p>

<p>Day broke fine and crisp with a light northerly breeze off
the ice. Picking the most promising lead toward Herald
Island, we pushed the <em>Jeannette</em> into it, and for two hours
amidst drifting floes we made our way with no great trouble,
when, to our dismay, we began to meet new ice in the lead,
from one to two inches in thickness. For another two hours,
we pushed along through this, our steel-clad stem easily
breaking a path through which we drove our hull, with the
thin ice scratching and gouging our elm doubling, when we
came at last smack up against the thickest pack we had yet
seen, some ten to fifteen feet of solid ice. This, needless to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
say, brought us up short. Since we could do nothing else,
we ran out our ice-anchor to the floe ahead, while we waited
hopefully for some shift in the pack to make us a new
opening.</p>

<p>With clearer weather, several times during the morning
as we lay in the ice, we made out distinctly not only Herald
Island but other land beyond, above, and also to the southwest
of it, which from everything we had been told, should
be part of that Wrangel Land on which we were banking
so much to afford us a base for our sledging operations
toward the Pole. Consequently we searched the distant outlines
of this continent with far greater interest than we had
bestowed on the nearer profile of Herald Island, but to no
conclusion. Danenhower, Chipp, and De Long, all experienced
seamen, strained their eyes through glasses, scanning
what could be seen of the coast of Wrangel Land, but so
far even from agreeing on its remoteness, looking across ice
instead of water so upset their habits of judging, that their
estimates of its distance varied all the way from forty to one
hundred miles, while De Long even doubted whether what
he saw beyond Herald Island was land at all but simply a
mirage. Being only an engineer, I took no part in these discussions,
more concerned myself in staring at the unyielding
edges of the nearby floes and wondering, if our navigation
for the next few weeks was to consist mostly of traversing
leads filled with such floating ice cakes, how long we could
hope to go before an ice floe sucked in under our counter
knocked off a propeller blade, and how long a time would
elapse before our four spare blades were all used up. But
there was no great occasion for such worry on my part. Not
till afternoon could we move at all, and then only for a
couple of hours, when once more we were brought up by
solid ice ahead and with banked fires again anchored to a
floe, called it a day, and laid below for supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>Supper was an unusually somber meal. Such an early season
encounter with the ice-fields and at so low a latitude, was a
sad blow to our hopes of exploration. De Long, at the head
of the table, served out silently as Tong Sing placed the
dishes before him; I, on his left, carved the mutton and aided
him at serving—to Chipp first, then to the others on both
sides of the table down to Danenhower, who as mess treasurer
sat at the foot of the table opposite the captain. Potatoes,
stewed dried apples, bread, butter, and tea made up
the rest of our unpretentious meal, the simplicity of which
perhaps still further emphasized our situation and put a
damper on any conversation. Only the shuffling of the Chinese
steward’s feet on the deck as he padded round the little
wardroom with the plates broke the quiet.</p>

<p>De Long, brooding over the ship’s situation, was gradually
struck by the absence of conversation and its implications.
More I think to make conversation than in the hope of gaining
any information, he picked out the ice-pilot on my left,
sawing earnestly away at his mutton, and asked him,</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Dunbar, do you think we’ll get through this
lead to Herald Island?”</p>

<p>Dunbar, absorbed like the rest of us in his thoughts, surprised
me by the speed, so unusual for him, with which without
even looking up he snapped out his reply,</p>

<p>“No, cap’n, we won’t!” Then more slowly as he turned
his grizzled face toward the head of the table, he added vehemently,
“And what’s more, while God’s giving us the
chance, I’d wind her in that little water hole astern of us and
head out of this ice back to open water before the bottom
drops out of the thermometer and we’re frozen in here for
a full due!”</p>

<p>Astonished by the heat of this unexpected reply, De Long
looked from the old whaler, who in truth had hurled a lance
into the very heart of each man’s thoughts, to the rest of us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
all suddenly straightened up by the thrust.</p>

<p>“And why, Mr. Dunbar?” in spite of a pronounced flush
he asked mildly. “Where can we do better, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Further east, off Prince Patrick’s Land, to the north’ard
of the coast of North America,” replied Dunbar shortly. “A
whaler’ll stay in open water further north’n this over on the
Alaska side most any time; the current sets that way toward
Greenland, not this side toward Siberia.”</p>

<p>De Long calmly shook his head.</p>

<p>“No use, pilot; we’re not whaling and we’ll not go east.
That would take us away from Wrangel Land, and sledging
north along the coasts of Wrangel Land’s our only hope
for working into the real north from Behring Strait. No,
we can’t do it. We’ll have to take our chances here.”</p>

<p>Dunbar, his suggestion overruled, made no reply, masking
his disappointment by hunching a little lower over his plate
and hacking away once more at the chunk of mutton before
him. And as suddenly as it had flared up, all conversation
ceased.</p>

<p>September 6 dawned, for us on the <em>Jeannette</em> a day to
which we often looked back with mingled feelings. During
the night our water lead froze up behind us. In the morning,
as far as the eye could see in every direction now was only
ice—no water, no open leads anywhere. A fog hung over the
sea, blotting out Herald Island, but a light northerly wind
gave some promise of clearing the atmosphere later on.</p>

<p>We gathered at breakfast in the cabin, a somber group.
Under way for a week since leaving Cape Serdze Kamen, we
had made but 240 miles to the north, to reach only lat.
71° 30′ N., a point easily to be exceeded by any vessel all
year round in the Atlantic. But here we were, completely
surrounded by ice. Was this the exceptionally open Arctic
summer, so free of ice, that in Unalaska we had been informed
awaited us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>Danenhower, loquacious as always, broke the silence,
observing to no one in particular,</p>

<p>“This damned coffee’s even worse than usual, all water and
no coffee beans. Ah Sam’s had time enough to learn by now.
Can’t anyone persuade that Chink to put <em>some</em> coffee in the
pot? What’s he saving it for?”</p>

<p>“Maybe the sight of all that ice discourages him,” observed
Ambler. “Perhaps he thinks we’re in for a long hard
winter and he’s got to save. I reckon he’s right too, for that
ice pack sure looks to me as if it never has broken up and
turned to water yet.”</p>

<p>“Right, surgeon.” Captain De Long at the head of the
table, busily engaged in ladling out a dish of hominy, looked
up at Ambler and nodded pessimistically,</p>

<p>“And what’s worse for us, it looks to me as if it never will,
unless someone whistles up a heavy gale to break up the
pack.”</p>

<p>Chipp, uncomplainingly engaged in drinking down his portion
of the insipid coffee, took objection at this.</p>

<p>“Don’t try that, captain! In any gale that’d break up <em>this</em>
pack the pack’d break the <em>Jeannette</em> up in the process. No,
let Nature take her course melting that ice; it may be slower
but it’s safer.”</p>

<p>“Come down to earth!” broke in Danenhower. “Let’s leave
the pack a minute; it’ll be there for a while yet. I was talking
about coffee. Hasn’t anybody in this mess got influence
enough to get Ah Sam to pack a little coffee in the pot for
all this water to work on?”</p>

<p>“Well,” grinned Collins, seeing a chance to slip in a pun,
“you’re the navigator, Dan. Why don’t you try shooting that
Celestial’s equator? That ought to stir him up.”</p>

<p>Collins, chuckling happily, glanced round for approval.</p>

<p>Danenhower twisted his broad shoulders in his chair, directed
a blank stare at Collins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“Huh? If that’s another one of your puns, Mr. Meteorologist,
what’s the point?”</p>

<p>Collins stopped laughing and looked pained.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see it, Dan?” he asked. “Why, that one’s rich!
Celestial, equator, and you’re a navigator. Now, do you get
it?”</p>

<p>Danenhower, determined with the rest of us to squelch
Collins’ puns, looking as innocent of understanding as before,
replied flatly,</p>

<p>“No! I’m too dumb, I guess. Where’s the point?”</p>

<p>“Why, Ah Sam’s a Chinaman, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“If he’s not, then I’m one,” agreed Danenhower. “So far
I’m with you.”</p>

<p>“Well, all Chinamen are sons of Heaven, aren’t they? So
that makes him a Celestial. See? And you’re a navigator so
you shoot the stars; they’re celestial too. And anybody’s
stomach’s his equator, isn’t it? You see, it all hangs together
fine. Now do you get it?” inquired Collins anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’m damned if I see any connection in all this rigmarole
of yours with my attempts at getting better coffee,” muttered
Danenhower. “Does anybody?” He looked round.</p>

<p>Solemnly first De Long, then Chipp, Ambler and I all
shook our heads, gazing blandly at Collins for further elucidation
as to what the joke might be.</p>

<p>Collins looked from one to another of us, then in disgust
burst out,</p>

<p>“The farther all of you get from San Francisco, the weaker
grow your intellects!” He leaned back sulkily. “By the time
we get to the Pole, you won’t know your own names. Why,
that one’s good! They’d see it in New York right off. I’ve
half a mind to try it out on that Indian, Alexey. I’ll bet even
he sees it!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you try it on Ah Sam instead, then?” queried
Danenhower, rising. “If our cook sees it, there’s hope. Maybe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
next you can make him see why he ought to put some coffee
berries in the pot when he makes coffee, and that’ll be something
even my thick skull can understand!” He jerked on his
peacoat, lifted his bulky form from his chair, and strode to
the door. “I’m going on deck. I’m too dumb, I guess, to see
the points of Collins’ puns. But maybe if I’m not too blind
yet, I can see the ice, anyway.”</p>

<p>With a wink at Ambler, our navigator vanished. It seemed
to be working; perhaps we might yet cure Collins of his
continuous stream of puns, for most of them were atrocious,
and anyway, having now had a chance to get acquainted at
close range with punning, I heartily agreed with whoever it
was, Samuel Johnson I think, in averring that a pun was the
lowest form of wit. With us the case was serious—here with
the long Arctic night approaching, locking us within the
narrow confines of our vessel, we were shipmates with a
punster and no escape except to break him of it!</p>

<p>I rose also and went out on deck, the while Collins turned
his attention to Dunbar, trying to get him, who also knew
something of navigation, to admit that he at least saw the
point in the meteorologist’s play on words, but I am afraid
he picked the wrong person, for Dunbar’s grim visage remained
wholly unresponsive.</p>

<p>Out on deck, clad in a heavy peacoat with a sealskin cap
jammed tightly down over my bald spot, for the temperature
was down to 26° F., I looked around. A distant view was
impossible because of fog. Nearby were a few disconnected
pools of water covered by thin ice, but short of miraculously
jumping the ship from one pool to another over the intervening
floes, there seemed no way for us to make progress. I
glanced down our side. For several feet above the waterline,
the paint was gone and our elm doubling was everywhere
scraped bright with here and there a deep gouge in the wood
from some jagged floe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>De Long joined me at the rail, looked despondently off
through the mist, his pipe clenched between his teeth, the
while he puffed vigorously away at it.</p>

<p>“A grand country for any man to learn patience in, chief,”
he remarked glumly. “Since we can’t push through the pack
to Wrangel Land over there on the western horizon, I’ve
been hoping and praying at least to get the ship in to Herald
Island to make winter quarters before we were frozen in, but
look what’s happened!” He gazed over the bulwark at the
nearby hummocks. “Yesterday I hoped today would make
us an opening through to the land; today I hope tomorrow’ll
do it. And tomorrow—?” He shrugged his shoulders and left
me, to climb our frosted ratlines to the crow’s-nest on the
chance that from that elevation he might see over the fog.
This turned out a futile effort, since not till one p.m. when
the fog finally lifted, were we able to move.</p>

<p>With the weather clearing, I got up steam while De Long,
armed with binoculars, perched himself once more in the
crow’s-nest, Dunbar again straddled the fore topsail yard,
Chipp took the bridge, and we got underway for as odd a
bit of navigation as all my years of going to sea have ever
witnessed.</p>

<p>To start with, the only possible opening was on the port
bow, but with heavy ice ahead and astern, there was insufficient
room to maneuver the ship by backing to head her
for the opening. So over the side went Bosun Cole and half
the starboard watch, dragging with them one end of a six-inch
hawser. Selecting a sizeable ice hummock a few shiplengths
off on the port side which gave a proper lead to our
forecastle bitts, Cole expertly threw a clove hitch in the
hawser round the hummock, using the ice, so to speak, as a
bollard; while on deck, Quartermaster Nindemann heaved in
on the ship end of that line with our steam winch, warping
the bow smartly round to port till it pointed fair for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
opening, when Chipp gave me the signal,</p>

<p>“Slow ahead!”</p>

<p>With a few turns of the propeller, we pushed our bow
into the crack between the floes. After that, with the line
cast off, it was a case of full out on the throttle. With connecting
rods, cranks, and pistons flying madly round, we
certainly churned up a wild wake in that narrow lead wedging
those cakes apart while the <em>Jeannette</em> squeezed herself in
between the ice floes.</p>

<p>And so it went for the next three hours, the captain and
the ice-pilot directing from aloft, while in the engine room
we nearly tore the engines off their bedplates and the smoking
thrust block off its foundation with all our sudden
changes from “Full ahead” to “Full astern” and everything
in between, while the <em>Jeannette</em> rammed, squeezed, backed,
and butted her way through the ice, sometimes relying only
on the engines, sometimes only on Jack Cole and his mates
plodding along on the floes ahead of the ship dragging that
six-inch hawser and occasionally taking a turn with it on
some hummock to help warp the ship into position for ramming.
Our solid bow and thick sides took a terrific beating
that watch as we hammered our way through pack ice deeper
than our keel, but everything held, and when we finally
ceased a little after four, it was not from any fear of the
consequences to the <em>Jeannette</em>, but only because the fog
came down again, blotting out everything.</p>

<p>Once more we ran out our ice-anchor, and with that
secured, recalled aboard the warping party. I came up out
of the engine room, having taken enough out of our engines
in a few hours to drive us halfway to China. Chipp, Danenhower,
and the captain all were gathered on the bridge over
my head.</p>

<p>“Well, Dan, how much’ve we made good toward Herald
Island?” I enquired eagerly of Danenhower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>The navigator’s thickset brows contracted dejectedly as he
peered down at me over the after rail.</p>

<p>“Maybe a mile, chief,” he answered.</p>

<p>Maybe a mile? And to get that mile, keeping up a full
head of steam all the time for ramming, I had been burning
coal furiously these past three hours. A hundred miles of
progress at that rate and our coal would be completely gone.
I turned questioningly toward the captain, asked,</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s bank fires now and save coal, hey, brother?”</p>

<p>Before answering De Long looked off through the fog.
Ice ahead, ice astern, ice on both beams, with only tiny disconnected
patches of water showing here and there among
the floes. He shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, chief, we won’t bank this time. Let your fires die
out altogether; save every pound of coal you can. If a good
chance comes to move, I’ll give you ample time to get steam
up again.”</p>

<p>And so we left it. As the day ended, the <em>Jeannette</em>, hemmed
in by ice, lay an inert ship, unable to move in any direction,
as a matter of form only, held to an ice-anchor; while below,
after securing the engines, I reduced the watch to one man
only, young Sharvell, coalheaver, left to tend the boilers
while the fires died out in them.</p>

<p>The temperature, which never during that day rose above
the freezing point, started to drop toward evening and soon
fell to 23°. The result was inevitable. Young ice, making during
the night over all patches of open water, had by morning
completely cemented together the old pack.</p>

<p>One look over the side in the midwatch satisfied me there
would be no call for the engines next day, nor unless something
startling happened, for many a day. All the steam I
could put behind my engines could not stir the <em>Jeannette</em> one
inch from her bed, and as for warping her now with our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
winch, our stoutest hawsers would be about as useful as
threads in tearing her from that grip of ice.</p>

<p>And so September 6, 1879, ended with the helpless <em>Jeannette</em>
solidly frozen into the Arctic ice pack.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">That freezing into immobility of the <em>Jeannette</em> in so low a
latitude, fell like an icy shower on the spirits of our wardroom
mess, and from that day sociability vanished. Already
Dunbar and Newcomb were not on speaking terms; Collins
regarded me sullenly and the rest of the mess hardly less
so; and the captain, who on leaving St. Michael’s, had after
an unpleasant disagreement with Mr. Collins in the wardroom,
decided that he should be more punctilious and less
informal in his intercourse with us, now withdrew into his
official shell completely. For myself, this worried me not at
all, for I well knew the effect that responsibility has on most
skippers, and particularly realized (as De Long seemed finally
also to have done) that for a captain not much senior in years
nor in rank to most of his officers, close comradeship is incompatible
with the maintenance of proper respect and
authority.</p>

<p>However, if we had no sociability to cheer us up, we soon
had plenty of other matters to make us forget the lack. The
ice pack which held us was evidently under way, headed
northward, and we had not been in the pack a day before
the pressure, nipping us on the beam, shoved the <em>Jeannette</em>
up on a submerged tongue of ice projecting somewhere below
our port bilge, giving us a list to starboard of over 5°
and causing some inconvenience in getting about. As if this
were not enough, after a few watches to our great uneasiness
our list suddenly increased to 9°, and incidentally jammed
our rudder hard starboard.</p>

<p>Here was cause enough for real worry. A permanent list
of 9° is in itself a great nuisance in getting about on a ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
even in the tropics, but now with the temperature below
freezing and the decks slippery with ice, we were in a bad
way to keep footing. And if the list got worse and carried
away our rudder or laid us on our beam ends as it threatened
to do, what then?</p>

<p>We promptly bestirred ourselves. Under Lieutenant
Chipp’s direction, improvised torpedoes made of kegs full
of black powder were planted in the ice under our stern,
but with no results. In spite of an all day struggle, not a
torpedo could we explode. To Chipp’s intense chagrin, every
fuse we had proved defective and would not burn. And an
attempt to fire the charges with that newfangled device,
electricity, also failed, apparently because our current was
so weak it all leaked away through our non-insulated copper
wires into the ice, leaving not enough at the terminals to
set off our torpedoes.</p>

<p>To aggravate us while we toiled to straighten up our
ship, we had an extraordinarily clear day, giving a splendid
view across the ice of Herald Island off to the westward,
with far beyond it a distinct range of peaks—Wrangel Land
which, when we set out on our expedition we had fondly
expected to spend the winter exploring. Frozen in, Heaven
only knows how far away from it, we gritted our teeth and
worked in the freezing weather to explode those torpedoes
but to no purpose. Night fell and left us still in that perilous
position.</p>

<p>Our fourth day in the ice found us still struggling to right
the ship. The torpedoes were abandoned. We resorted to
more primitive methods, those used centuries ago on sailing
ships to careen for cleaning the hulls.</p>

<p>Jack Cole, bosun, and a gang of seamen swarmed up the
icy shrouds, rigged a couple of heavy tackles at the mastheads,
one at the fore, the other at the main, and secured
their lower ends to ice claws hooked under the thick floes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
on our port side.</p>

<p>Then to the hoarse cry of the bosun,</p>

<p>“Yo, heave!” our entire crew, stretched out along the
falls, lay back and foot by foot hove them well taut, till
our port shrouds came slack and the captain signalled to
belay hauling lest something carry away. But even under
this terrific strain on our masts tending to roll us to port,
our vessel, gripped firmly by the ice, righted herself not an
inch.</p>

<p>De Long, regarding with keen disappointment our strained
cordage and bent masts, had still one more shot in the locker.
Torpedoes had failed, careening had failed, but we had yet
an ice saw. He motioned to Alfred Sweetman, our tall English
carpenter, standing at the base of the mainmast dubiously
eyeing the overstrained crosstrees above him.</p>

<p>“Rig that ice saw, Sweetman!”</p>

<p>The carpenter responded hurriedly. While Jack Cole
braced back the main yard so that its port end plumbed
our quarter, Sweetman and his mates broke out from the
hold our ice saw, a huge steel blade twenty feet long and
broad in proportion, its cutting edge studded with coarse
teeth that would have done credit to any full-grown shark.</p>

<p>Under Nindemann’s direction, the port watch went over
the side armed with pick-axes and crowbars and started to
break a hole for the saw through the ice on our quarter,
while Cole and Sweetman swung the saw from a tackle at
the yardarm, weighted its lower end with a small kedge
anchor, and then awaited the completion of the hole through
the floe. They had several hours to wait, for not till the
gang on the pack had dug down fifteen feet did a crowbar
go through into the open water below, which, gushing unexpectedly
upward into the hole, soaked the diggers with
freezing spray and sent them madly scrambling up the rough
sides of their excavation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>Fifteen feet of ice! De Long’s mustaches drooped for a full
due when Nindemann reported that. Only mid-September,
and already fast in ice extending two feet below our keel!
A gigantic block of ice to try to cut, but there was nothing
for it but to saw away if we were ever to right our ship.
Fortunately our saw was at least long enough.</p>

<p>The bosun plumbed the hole with the kedge anchor suspended
from the yardarm, hauled everything two-blocks,
and then,</p>

<p>“Let go!” he roared.</p>

<p>Down came the kedge with a run, crashed into the thin
remaining ice-floor of the hole, broke through, carrying the
lower end of the saw with it, and we were ready.</p>

<p>Then commenced four hours of strenuous labor. Sweetman
and Nindemann, armed with crowbars, down on the pack
guided the sides of the saw blade for a fore and aft cut,
while on deck the starboard watch stretched out along the
fall, alternately heaved and slacked away, on the upstroke
lifting the weight of both saw and kedge anchor, on the
downstroke depending on the weight of the kedge only to
drag the blade down again, while on both strokes the steel
teeth rasped and shrieked and tortured our ears as they tore
into the solid ice.</p>

<p>But it was useless. In spite of Sweetman’s skilled guidance
and Nindemann’s brawny shoulders, it was next to impossible
to keep that blade going straight against such thick ice,
for the bottom of the saw being so far below them, actually
guiding it was wholly out of question, with the result that
on nearly every stroke the saw jammed in the cut. After
half a day’s arduous labor the net results were a badly bent
saw, hardly a fathom of cut ice, and such a flow of sulphurous
language both on deck and on the ice pack from those
handling the saw that I doubt not it may well have melted
more ice than we cut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>So at eight bells, when the gang over the side knocked
off for mess, De Long, ruefully contemplating the twisted
saw temporarily hanging in the clear at the yardarm, and
the insignificant length of the cut compared with the stretch
of ice along our hull which had yet to be severed, gave up
and silently motioned Cole to unrig everything. With alacrity,
all hands as soon as this was done, scrambled below to
the forecastle.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, in the comparative warmth of the
wardroom (50° instead of the 16° out on deck) with some
difficulty on account of the slope, I eased myself into my
chair near the head of the table on the captain’s left, silently
bracing my plate with my knife to keep it from sliding away
to starboard while Tong Sing ladled out the soup, hardly
more than half filling my plate lest the steaming liquid overflow
the low side.</p>

<p>“Well, mates,” observed Danenhower, at the low end of
the table, contemplating his scanty portion, “such is life in
the Arctic! We’re in for this list all winter. I’m glad I don’t
like soup anyway. Stew’s more in my line.”</p>

<p>“Better see Ah Sam, then, Dan,” I advised, “and make sure
he thickens that stew enough to insure a safe angle of repose,
or your stew’ll flow away like the soup.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, boys; I’ll fix it,” broke in our executive
officer, Mr. Chipp. “If we can’t right our ship, I can right
this mess table anyhow. I’ll have the carpenter saw a foot
off each of the legs on the high end and that’ll about compensate
for the heel and level it off for us.”</p>

<p>“Chipp, I’m ashamed of you,” I objected. “Your cure’s
worse’n the disease. That’ll fix the slope, true enough, but
what’ll the skipper and you and I do? Shortening these legs
a foot will put this end of the table in our laps. How’ll we
eat then; cross-legged on the deck like a lot of Japs? Maybe
you can, you must be used to it, being just back from there!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
But I’m afraid I’m too stiff in the joints to flemish down my
legs properly!”</p>

<p>Chipp, who had just come back from the Orient to join
the <em>Jeannette</em>, saw the point, considered a moment, then
looked speculatively down the table to the low end where
sat the mess treasurer and the juniors in the mess.</p>

<p>“You’re right, chief. That’ll never do; there’s too much
rank up here to monkey with this end of the table. Instead,
I’ll have Sweetman level off by adding a foot to those table
legs on the starboard end.”</p>

<p>Immediately Danenhower, facing the captain from the low
end of the table, flared up.</p>

<p>“And what do you expect <em>me</em> to do then, Mr. Chipp?
Get myself a high chair like a damned infant so I can reach
the table while I eat? And wear a bib too, maybe? Forget
it!”</p>

<p>Chipp, squelched from both ends of the table, shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Well, I give up, mates! Anchor your soup plates anyway
you can then. But don’t be blaming me if your chow finishes
in the scuppers instead of down your gullets.” He relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>The meal proceeded with difficulty. Tong Sing, bending
low over each man’s shoulder in succession, sought to maintain
his grip on the sloping deck the while he tried to level
off the platter of salt pork long enough for each to help
himself, but it was evident that it was only a matter of time
till one of us got the contents of that platter in his lap. After
two near accidents, avoided only by skillful juggling of the
platter by the impassive Tong Sing, the captain motioned
the steward to quit serving and put the dish down before
him.</p>

<p>“Enough, Charley. Set that platter down right here. Lend
a hand, Melville, at passing those plates, and I’ll serve out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
myself. We’ll have to let formality in serving go by the
board till spring’s here and we’re on an even keel again. Let’s
have your plate now, Dan,” he called, as the relieved steward
deposited the heaping dish of pork before the captain and
padded off to the galley for the potatoes.</p>

<p>“Spring? When does spring arrive around these parts?”
asked Danenhower irrelevantly, passing his plate.</p>

<p>“God knows, I don’t!” replied Chipp. “By June, I hope
though. Why, Dan?”</p>

<p>“By June, eh?” The navigator counted on his fingers.
“Nine months yet. And nine months more of having to navigate
these careened decks is going to be tough on the legs.
I’ll have a permanent limp in my left leg long before that,
trying to keep erect.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ambler seated in the middle of the table looked at
Danenhower, nodded seriously, and in his quiet Virginian
drawl observed,</p>

<p>“You’re right, Dan. And since we can’t right the ship,
we’ll have to level off the crew. What Chipp just said gave
me an idea. How about my amputating a couple of inches
from everybody’s left leg, just enough to counteract the list?
That’ll keep you all on an even keel.”</p>

<p>“Hah, hah!” roared Chipp, looking at the doctor in mock
amazement. “For a naval surgeon, my dear Ambler, your
lack of seamanship pains me! Shorten our left legs, indeed?
That’s all very well for a starboard list when a man’s going
forward, but where’ll he be when he comes about and wants
to go aft? Worse than ever, with his short flipper on the
wrong side! Not for me, doctor. I’ll reef my legs myself on
whichever side’s necessary. Your idea’s worse than mine!”</p>

<p>“I’m sunk,” admitted Ambler with a grin. “So that won’t
work after all! And it looked such a grand scheme with a
little easy surgery on the crew to avoid having to operate
on all that ice!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“If we stay here long enough,” observed Newcomb, “according
to that new theory which my fellow naturalist, that
great English scientist Darwin, recently advanced, Nature
will accommodate us to our environment. The survival of
the fittest, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, ‘Bugs,’ that means we’ll all ultimately become polar
bears or perish,” commented Ambler. “And since I don’t look
with pleasure to doing either, let’s hope you and your biology
are both wrong.”</p>

<p>By this time, fortunately all were served, and in the ensuing
attack on the salt pork, conversation languished. But
in spite of the badinage about our situation and the half-humorous
remedies proposed to alleviate the nuisance of
forever battling the sloping decks in working, the sloping
tables in eating, and even the sloping bunks when we tried
to sleep, it was evident that in the back of everyone’s mind
was a lurking fear of what next the ice had in store for us.
And the futility of our efforts in combating the ice pack
were now too plain to all of us to sustain any further hope
of effecting in the slightest degree any position our ship
might assume, let alone her movements.</p>

<p>For some days we drifted impotently with the pack toward
the northwest. With broken ice under pressure piling up
along our high side and jamming our rudder hard against
the pintles, the captain (who inwardly had been hoping for
a series of September gales to come along and break up the
pack and free us) at last reluctantly gave the order to unship
it, which task with great difficulty on account of the thick
ice, Cole and Sweetman finally succeeded in accomplishing,
tricing the rudder up to the davits across the stern. So the
end of the first week found us a rudderless ship moving at
the whim of the ice pack, all chance of exploration gone,
stopped at latitude 71° North, a latitude which had easily
been reached in these same waters twenty years before by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
sailing ship. And gnawing bitterly at our captain’s soul
was the knowledge that till summer came to free us, in spite
of steam or sail, the <em>Jeannette</em> Polar Expedition must drift
idly with the pack, so far from the Pole as to be the laughing
stock of the world when it became known, the while we
consumed our supplies, burned up our coal, and wore out
our bodies to no purpose.</p>

<p>Where was the pack taking us? Anxiously we daily
watched the trend of the driftlead dropped to the bottom
through a hole in the ice under our stern, then checked
against occasional bearings of distant Herald Island and the
few astronomical observations Danenhower got through the
fogs. The navigator announced finally that we were drifting
northwest with the pack, at a rate of about two miles per
<em>day</em>. Where would that lead us? And when? By spring, to
the shores of Wrangel Land perhaps, the captain hoped, not
overly optimistic apparently even for actual realization of
that prospect.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I prepared for the worst below. To save coal,
fires had on the day the ice caught us, been allowed to die
out under the boilers. Now with our underwater hull practically
sheathed in ice, the cold below was increasing, and
to avoid freezing boilers and pipelines and bursting them as
a result, it was necessary to free everything of water, leaving
boilers, pumps, and engines empty, dry, and unfortunately as
a consequence, unavailable for immediate service if required.
Not to have some steam up and his auxiliaries, at least, ready
for service, would irk any engineer. But to be even more
helpless below, not even to have boilers filled and ready to
light off in an emergency, gave me serious cause for worry.
However, there was no way out. Keeping the water warm
in the boilers and lines meant keeping fires alight which
would consume precious fuel and leave us with empty
bunkers when the ice at last released us and we could steam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
again. Keeping water in the boilers and lines without the
fires, meant freezing and bursting our lines and perhaps our
boilers, leaving us helpless to utilize the coal we had saved.
One horn of that dilemma was as bad as the other; was ever
an engineer faced with a worse choice of evils? The only
way out was to be even more reckless, to empty everything,
save coal, avoid freezing, and trust to luck that in a pinch
somehow the boilers could be filled again with water, fired
up, and steam raised once more before it was too late.</p>

<p>And that I did. Lee, machinist, and Bartlett, fireman, who
were acting as my assistant engineers, turned to with their
wrenches. Aided by the rest of the black gang, Boyd, Lauterbach,
Iversen, and Sharvell, serving as a bucket brigade,
they were soon busy breaking pipe joints, draining out water,
drying out the boilers, and finally assembling everything as
free of moisture as it was humanly possible to get it.</p>

<p>And that completed the job of reducing the <em>Jeannette</em> to
a helpless hulk. No rudder with which to steer, no steam
with which to move her engines, she was more helpless even
than Noah’s <em>Ark</em>, which indeed she soon came to resemble
when the portable deck house we brought with us from San
Francisco was finally erected.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">On the <em>Jeannette</em>, we settled down to spending the winter
in the ice pack. The first step was to turn loose on the ice
all our dogs—a proceeding greeted with yelps of joy from
the dogs at no longer being prisoners, and cheers from the
men who foresaw not only the prospect once again of living
in some peace and safety, but also of keeping our decks clean
and shipshape. There was only one drawback. Some distance
from the ship we had planted bear-traps in the hope of varying
our menu with fresh meat. To our disgust, instead of
bear, our first catch was one of our best dogs, Smike, nipped
by the foreleg between the jaws of a trap. With some difficulty,
Aneguin extricated the yelping brute and the starboard
wing of the bridge having been converted to a dog
hospital, Smike was turned in for repairs. Hardly had this
been done before a second dog, Kasmatka this time, sprang
another trap and Aneguin had two patients for his canine
sickbay. This disturbed the captain, who fearful of losing all
our dogs with the sledging season coming on, ordered the
traps set out only at night when all the dogs had been herded
aboard.</p>

<p>Meanwhile De Long kept a watchful eye on Herald Island
looming up in the distance as we drifted with the ice to the
northwest. Our skipper, anxious to discover if the island contained
any driftwood which might serve us for fuel, or a
possible harbor if by any chance the hoped-for September
gales broke up the pack and allowed us by steaming up
again to reach it, determined on exploring it while still it
bore abeam, apparently only five miles off. So on the captain’s
orders, Chipp, Alexey, and I made up an exploring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
party, taking a sledge, eight dogs, and provisions for a week.
We set off on the morning of September 13, cheered by all
the crew, and immediately I discovered something about dog
teams. Instead of my boyhood pictures of a dog team racing
in full cry over the snow with the Eskimo driver having
nothing to do except to snap a whip as he gracefully reclined
on the sledge, there was chaos. The dogs yelped
and fought; the leaders battling in the rear, the rear dogs in
the center, the harness all atangle, and progress the last
thing apparently any dog was interested in. It took all our
efforts to untangle the mess and get underway, with Alexey
whipping the dogs to hold them in line, and Chipp and I behind
pushing the sledge to get it started and encourage the
dogs. Fortunately for us, the going at first was fair, with
much young ice, still smooth and unbroken to ease our path,
but we soon ran into rough and broken floes, over which we
toiled for hours. In this wise we covered fifteen miles without
Herald Island appearing any closer when, to our dismay,
a wide open water lead blocked our path. From the edge of
that gap we scanned the island beyond, still five miles away
but clearly visible through the frosty air, to find that its
shores were precipitous cliffs of rock, offering no signs of a
safe harbor even if we could have worked the <em>Jeannette</em> inshore,
while there was not the slightest evidence of vegetation
or of any driftwood which might ease our fuel problem.</p>

<p>Chipp and I considered the situation. Without a boat, it
was folly to attempt proceeding farther—we might, even if
we managed to skirt this lead and make a landing on the
island, find our return cut off by other leads and with our
ship being carried to the northward by the drifting ice, be
left to starve on that barren rock. Reluctantly then we turned
back, but so slow was our progress over the rough ice pack
we were forced at last to camp on the ice for the night. It
was not till nine the next morning, which happened to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Sunday, that we sighted the ship, a little glum at returning
with nothing to show for our journey except one small seal
which Alexey had shot at the edge of the lead and which
we carried strapped down on the sledge.</p>

<p>Instead of the peaceful calm of a Sunday morning, however,
I found the ship in a turmoil. As we approached the
stern with our sledge, trudging wearily along in Alexey’s
wake and watching eagerly the thin column of smoke from
the galley that to us meant just one thing—a hot breakfast—someone
on deck shouted,</p>

<p>“Bear!”</p>

<p>The next I knew, down the gangway onto the ice came
the quartermaster, Nindemann, a rifle in his hand, running in
his stockinged feet as hard as he could toward our stem.
Sure enough, there galloping off past the bow, was a big
polar bear who quickly faded from view, but that meant
nothing as white bears naturally enough do not stand out
long against an ice background. A bear! Fresh meat instead
of salt beef, if we got him! But polar bears had a reputation
for ferocity and there was Nindemann, single-handed, going
after one. What might not the bear do to him among those
hummocks? Chipp and I looked at each other questioningly.
Being somewhat ungainly and rather stout, I can hardly say
that Nature ever designed me for chasing bears, besides
which, having just tramped thirty miles across the broken pack,
I hardly felt equal to joining any bear hunts, and I was about
to suggest we let the Indian, Alexey, go in support, leaving
us to struggle with the dogs, when the problem was solved
for us. Down the gangway, going four bells in Nindemann’s
wake came Danenhower, also flourishing a rifle, and in no
time at all after that, Collins and Newcomb, both armed,
shot down the gangplank also and were off on the run. By
the time our sledge made the gangway and we hauled our
tired legs up the incline, not only the bear but all four hunters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
were out of sight among the hummocks.</p>

<p>As we came over the side, I looked questioningly round for
the watch officer to report my return aboard, but except
for Dunbar who was already half up the foreshrouds on his
way to the crosstrees, undoubtedly to get a better view of
the chase, there wasn’t a man in sight on deck, so without
further ceremony, both Chipp and I laid below to the wardroom,
where, furs and all, we planked ourselves wearily down
at the mess table, calling loudly for Tong Sing and hot coffee.
At the table, in no wise disturbed by the shouting on deck,
was Captain De Long, still lingering over his breakfast.
Eagerly he questioned us about Herald Island while we ate;
his disappointment at our report, utterly dashing his hope
that the island might ever serve him as a base, was plainly
evident, though he tried to conceal it from us by changing
the subject.</p>

<p>“Well, Chipp, there’s still Wrangel Land to look forward
to.” He gazed listlessly up at the wardroom clock. “But that’ll
have to wait. Right now I believe it’s time for Sunday inspection.
Have Nindemann muster the crew immediately on
deck.”</p>

<p>“Nindemann, sir?” asked Chipp puzzled, having just seen
our quartermaster vanishing on a bear hunt.</p>

<p>“Yes, Nindemann of course. He has the watch now.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, captain,” answered Chipp, “but Nindemann went
over the side just before we returned chasing a bear. He
must be over a mile from here by now. However, now I’m
back, sir, I’ll muster the crew myself.”</p>

<p>“Nindemann gone, you say? When he had the watch?
Who gave him permission to leave; Danenhower, I wonder?”
De Long frowned, then motioned to Tong Sing. “Tell Mr.
Danenhower I want to see him right away.”</p>

<p>“Dan’s gone too, sir,” put in Chipp quickly before the
steward could leave. “He followed Nindemann after that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
bear, to back him up, I suppose. I’ll arrange for the inspection,
sir.”</p>

<p>De Long’s frown deepened perceptibly at this.</p>

<p>“So the navigator and the watch officer are both gone,
eh? Who’d they leave in charge on deck?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know, captain,” answered the executive officer,
“unless it might have been the ice-pilot. But Mr. Dunbar
was halfway up the foremast when we came aboard, so I
can’t just say.”</p>

<p>The skipper stroked his mustaches thoughtfully, finally
ordered,</p>

<p>“Never mind the inspection, Chipp. I’ll delay it till they’re
back. But this won’t do. Even if we are in the ice, I can’t
have my crew disappearing from the ship whenever they see
fit. Pass the word to all hands at the next muster that hereafter
no officer or man leaves this vessel without first getting
my permission. Do you understand that, Chipp?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” replied Chipp. “Having just been across
thirty miles of this infernal ice, I quite agree with you, captain.
We can’t have our men chasing God knows where
among these hummocks and never knowing who’s gone nor
why. But it’s not the men’s fault this time, sir, it’s mine. I
should have covered that by an order a week ago when we
entered the ice.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that, Chipp,” broke in De Long, “I’ll issue
the order, you just tell Danenhower and Nindemann I want
to see them when they return.” He rose abruptly, pulled on
his fur parka, and went on deck.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on the distant pack, the bear hunt was in full
cry, first the bear under a full head of steam, then Nindemann
tenaciously following in his wake, then Danenhower
a few hundred yards astern getting somewhat winded, and
finally bringing up the rear of the column, Newcomb and
Collins. Over the broken ice and in and out among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
hummocks ran the bear, giving his pursuers no chance for
a decent shot, and all the time (by instinct, no doubt) heading
away from the <em>Jeannette</em> till it was lost to sight. After
fifteen minutes of hot pursuit, Danenhower, torn between
the need of supporting Nindemann ahead of him and the neglected
Sunday inspection behind, and disheartened also by
observing that the bear was steadily gaining, stopped at last,
till the rear guard caught up with him and paused briefly
at his signal.</p>

<p>“We haven’t a ghost of a chance now of catching that
bear,” panted the winded navigator to his companions, “so
I’m going back to prepare the ship for inspection. But you
two keep on to help Nindemann in case that bear makes a
stand. Savvy?”</p>

<p>Collins and Newcomb, saving their breath, nodded and
set off again.</p>

<p>Danenhower, puffing heavily, returned to the ship, hurriedly
mustered the crew on deck, officers to starboard,
seamen to port, and finally, an hour late, went below to report
to the captain that the ship was ready for inspection.</p>

<p>In the chill winter morning, with the thermometer not
much above zero, we stood in our furs, officers indistinguishable
in those baggy garments from seamen, waiting for the
captain to emerge. A bleak enough scene. Along our whole
port side was broken ice, piled up by the pressure (which
was heeling us to starboard) in irregular heaps till it came
practically fair with the rail and threatened if the pressure
increased to rise still higher and flow like a glacier down our
sloping deck. Aloft as usual, our rigging was outlined in
ice, our masts and spars cased in it, and our furled sails
against the yards so thoroughly frozen into a solid mass that
had we wished to spread our canvas, it would have been
beyond the power of human hands even with axes to loose
one fold from another. That made me smile a bit. Our sails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
were even more useless than our engines, for given time, I
could at least fire up again; but I could see no way in which
Chipp could possibly make sail till summer came once more.</p>

<p>In the midst of my meditations, De Long emerged from
the poop. Swiftly Danenhower called the roll, saluted the
captain, reported three men absent. The captain, to whom
by now this was no news, acknowledged curtly. The crew
was dismissed, fell out, went below, and stood by their
various stations there while the skipper inspected the berth
deck, the galley, the storerooms, and in short, every space
and hold, commenting briefly now and then. As a whole
the ship was dry; in spite of the cold outside, no condensation
and no frost as yet showed in our living quarters or
storerooms.</p>

<p>Inspection over, the bosun passed the word for Divine
Service in the cabin aft, but except for the officers aboard,
the captain’s congregation was small. Attendance being voluntary,
the majority of the crew stayed away, which may
perhaps have been taken as a good omen for I well believe
the old saying to be so, that the reliance of a sailor in God
is in inverse proportion to his faith in the strength of his
ship. Evidently then our seamen, seeing no special danger in
our predicament, felt no great need for prayer, leaving that
to the captain, who, they well knew, was in the absence of a
chaplain required by the Navy Regulations to hold services.
I may say here, however, for Captain De Long that he was
a deeply religious man and it required no compulsion from
the Regulations in his case to insure Divine Service and to
ask the blessing of the Almighty upon his undertaking and
his crew. Personally however, his position in the matter was
a little odd, because De Long himself was of the Catholic
faith. Nevertheless since most of the crew were if anything
Protestants, he always conducted the services in the Episcopal
ritual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>Services over, we laid up on deck, to find practically the
whole crew lining the rail watching the absent hunters straggling
back across the ice pack to the ship, with the winded
Nindemann leading and the other two well in his rear. There
were no signs of the bear, who had evidently successfully
outrun his pursuers, but what I think mostly engaged the
seamen’s attention as their eyes moved covertly from the
captain at the starboard gangway to the returning hunters
on the ice was their expectation of seeing the skipper light
into the absentees for missing inspection. Nindemann, first
over the side, a little surprised at seeing the captain at the
gangway instead of Dunbar to whom he had turned over the
the deck, saluted De Long, reported casually,</p>

<p>“Returning aboard, sir,” and unslinging his rifle, turned
to go below.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Nindemann.” The quartermaster paused,
De Long eyed him silently a moment, while the crew, a little
forward, looked eagerly for fireworks, but to their disappointment
De Long said very quietly,</p>

<p>“Nindemann, you were watch officer. For a quartermaster
with all your years at sea, I thought you knew better than
to leave the ship without permission. Never let it happen
again.”</p>

<p>Nindemann, his stolid German countenance flushing under
even that mild reproof, hesitated a moment between the relative
desirabilities of silence and justification, then muttered,</p>

<p>“But, cap’n, before yet I go, I turn over the deck to Mr.
Dunbar. And that bear, he was already yet running away.
There was not time for anything.”</p>

<p>De Long shook his head.</p>

<p>“In an emergency, Nindemann, a watch officer may turn
over the deck and leave. But a polar bear is not an emergency.
Don’t do it again. That’s all now. Go below.”</p>

<p>For an instant, hoping to explain further, the quartermaster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
hesitated but one glance into De Long’s quiet blue
eyes changed his mind.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir.” He gripped his rifle, shuffled forward
past his shipmates.</p>

<p>By this time, Collins and Newcomb were coming up the
gangway. The knot of sailors, disappointed in the expected
scene over Nindemann, lost interest and scattered. If the
captain would not blow up a seaman for a serious breach of
discipline, he would hardly lay out an officer for less. And
in this they were correct. De Long went below before the
two hunters reached the side; they reported their return to
Dunbar, and had not Danenhower stopped them might have
laid below unhindered. But the navigator, curious as to
events, laid a brawny arm on little Newcomb’s shoulder,
asked the naturalist banteringly,</p>

<p>“Well, ‘Bugs,’ how did you make out with that specimen
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ursus Polaris</i>?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ursus Polaris?</i> There is no such specimen. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thalassarctus
maritimus</i>, you mean,” blandly replied Newcomb. “I regret
to say the specimen outfooted us, and neither the quartermaster,
the meteorologist, nor I unfortunately got in a shot.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” agreed Danenhower, “but what by the way is
a thalassa—What did you say?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thalassarctus maritimus</i>,” repeated Newcomb. “What the
untutored call a polar bear or in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ursus Polaris</i>. That’s
all wrong. It’s an ice bear or, technically, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">thalassarctus
maritimus</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” grinned Danenhower, “marvellous how a
bear weighted down with a name like that can run, isn’t it?
By the way, ‘Bugs,’ when you’ve stowed your rifle, you’ll
have a chance to show off your Latin to the skipper. He
wants to see you in his cabin.” He turned from Newcomb
to the panting meteorologist. “And a little later he’d like
to see you too, Collins.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“Me? About what?” demanded Collins sharply.</p>

<p>“Just a little private warning about leaving the ship without
permission, I guess. He’s already reprimanded me for it.”
Danenhower laughed. “My fault, of course. I should have
known better.”</p>

<p>“Well, I <em>shouldn’t</em>,” snapped out Collins, and disappeared
through the door in the poop bulkhead, leaving Danenhower
looking after him, amazed at the heat of his reply.</p>

<p>Sunday dinner was a quiet meal in spite of the fact that
in the cabin for our main dish we had an unusual treat—roast
seal—the one that Alexey had shot on our trip to Herald
Island, and which we had dragged back on our sledge. The
seal meat was excellent, something like rabbit, I thought, and
a very welcome change from salted beef and pork, but nevertheless,
except for Danenhower chaffing Newcomb, there
was little conversation. I was tired from the journey to
Herald Island, so also I knew was Chipp, but the wet blanket
on the conversation was evidently Collins, who mum as a
clam sat through the meal without a word to anyone, and
as soon as he had cleaned his plate, departed suddenly
without a “By your leave” to anyone.</p>

<p>De Long, a little perplexed at Collins’ quick departure,
hastily drew a paper from his pocket, and broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, before anyone else leaves, here is an order
I’ve issued to prevent a repetition of what happened this
morning. Each of you please read and initial it.”</p>

<p>The order passed rapidly round the table. It was brief
enough, requiring each officer and man to get the captain’s
permission before leaving the ship, and requiring him to report
both his going and returning to the officer of the deck.
When all had noted and initialed it, the captain called to
Tong Sing,</p>

<p>“Charley, show this immediately to Mr. Collins, and tell
him to initial it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Tong Sing took the order, padded placidly out of the
cabin in search of our departed messmate.</p>

<p>A little later, I went on deck myself. There outboard of
the foremast, leaning on the port rail, morosely watching
the pack of dogs on the ice snarling and fighting over the
scraps of seal which Ah Sam had flung them, was Collins.
From his flushed face and his agitated manner it was evident
our meteorologist was much upset. While Collins’ puns had
always much annoyed me, and my casual jokes had no doubt
irritated him, still we were friends and on my appearance
from the poop, he beckoned me to join him, which I did.</p>

<p>“I’m trapped, chief!” he burst out heavily. “Back in the
States, my brother warned me I shouldn’t have shipped on
this cruise as a seaman, but like a fool, I didn’t believe him
then! Now it’s happened, and I’m trapped!”</p>

<p>“You trapped? What’s ailing you, Collins?” I asked, astonished
at this hysterical outburst. “We’re all trapped with
the <em>Jeannette</em> in the ice, but you’re no worse off than I am.”</p>

<p>“It’s not the ice, chief!” Collins gripped my arm, drew me
close to the rail. “It’s the captain! I’ve been fearing this for
weeks. You’re all right, you’re an officer. But I was fooled
into shipping as a seaman! Now the captain’s got me where
he wants me. Look at that!” He reached inside his parka.
I looked. “That” was a somewhat faded newspaper clipping
of an interview De Long had given a reporter from the
<em>Washington Post</em>, an interview which months before I had
once seen reprinted in a San Francisco newspaper.</p>

<p>“That’s where it started; look what De Long called me
there!” With a shaking finger Collins pointed to the middle
of the clipping, in a voice quivering with emotion, read an
extract,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘It may be that some specialists or scientists will be
invited or permitted to accompany us, but they will be
simply accessories.’</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“See that? <em>Accessories!</em>” Collins’ voice choked. “He’s
labeled me as simply an <em>accessory</em>, Melville! I should have
quit as my brother advised me when I first saw that interview,
not gone and shoved my head into a trap by signing as
a seaman!”</p>

<p>I looked at him curiously. Undoubtedly the man was overwrought,
seething with suppressed passion which something
had finally touched off. I tried to calm him.</p>

<p>“Now see here, Collins, what are you taking offense at?
What’s so bad about your being an accessory to the Navy in
this scientific stuff? You don’t think, do you, that in this
expedition De Long and the whole Navy should be accessories
to you?”</p>

<p>But Collins, boiling inwardly, did not even hear me. He
seized my arm again, continued vehemently,</p>

<p>“And now he’s sprung his trap. That order he just sent me
to sign! And to show what he thinks of me, he picks his
Chinaman to order me to sign it! I’m in his power, on the
books as just a seaman! Fool! If I’d had a grain of sense,
I shouldn’t have come except as an officer or at least as a
passenger!”</p>

<p>Collins was certainly beside himself. I looked swiftly
round, fearing he would make himself ridiculous before the
crew, but fortunately they were all still below, lingering over
their Sunday dinner. I turned back to Collins.</p>

<p>“But what’s bothering you anyway, brother? What’s this
trap you’re so excited about?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see it, chief? It’s plain enough. I’m only a
common seaman here. In the captain’s power! And now to
humiliate me, he’s forbidden me to leave the ship without
begging his permission!”</p>

<p>I stared at Collins incredulously. Was that all? If it had
not been for his overwrought features, I could have laughed
in his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t be so damned morbid, Collins,” I replied as gently
as I could. “About that seaman business, you’re as much an
officer aboard this ship as I am, regardless of how the law
required them to put you down on the ship’s articles. Don’t
you live in the cabin, mess with the officers, muster with the
officers? What more do you want? Some gold lace on your
sleeves? But even if you rated it, what good would it do
you? Not one of us wears it here. As for the captain’s order,
it hits me and every other officer and man aboard as much as
it does you. It’s just part of the ship’s discipline.”</p>

<p>“Ship’s discipline! Oh, no! That order’s aimed at me, personally!
To make me beg for every little right. To take
away my liberty. Because he fooled me into signing on as a
seaman, the captain thinks now he can take away my rights.
But I’ll show him! He can’t persecute me!”</p>

<p>Here was a damned mess. Hardly ten days in the ice and
our meteorologist already talking insanely about persecution.
He had the civilian’s foolish idea that aboard ship by some
hocus-pocus an officer was a god, a passenger a free agent,
and a seaman but a slave. Didn’t he realize by now that in
the Navy every man aboard ship was equally subject to the
captain’s authority; that in the hands of a tyrannical captain,
an officer’s stripes afforded no protection from abuse? That
if the captain really wished to humiliate and persecute him,
a commission as an officer could not possibly save him? I
tried to calm Collins’ fears.</p>

<p>“That order’s innocent enough, Collins, and it’s meant for
all hands. The skipper’d probably forgotten all about you
when he wrote it out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he didn’t! It’s aimed at me, all right. But I’ll
fool him!” Collins’ eyes positively glittered with rage. “Try
to make me beg his permission, huh? I’ll start a silent protest
by staying aboard. Before I ask De Long’s permission to
leave, I’ll not go off this ship again even if I die for it!”</p>

<p>I gazed at Collins in perplexity. An impulsive Irishman if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
there ever was one, going off half cocked over a perfectly
innocent order. What ailed the man? Did he think the captain
was jealous of his professional attainments; was he afraid
the captain meant to prevent him or anyone else aboard
from reaping what glory he might from the success of our
expedition? That outburst about being called an accessory—what
suppressed emotions did that reveal? Was Collins such
an idiot as to think that De Long after years of fighting and
sweating to make this expedition a reality, was now going
to act merely as sailing master on his own ship, putting aside
his own dreams and ambitions of discovery in favor of a
minor assistant of whose very existence he had been ignorant
till a few short months before? I would never have believed
such egotism possible, but as I looked into Collins’ distorted
face, I began to wonder. However, so far as I was concerned,
that was neither here nor there. We were going to
have a long time in the ice yet together, and if life was to
continue reasonably pleasant in the imprisoned <em>Jeannette’s</em>
cabin, Collins must not make a fool of himself.</p>

<p>“Come now, Collins,” I begged persuasively, “think it
over, and you’ll see what I tell you is so—the order’s reasonable
enough. But even if it weren’t, you’d only make a bad
matter worse by your ‘silent protest.’ I wouldn’t do that. It
bears on me the same as it does on you. Now I’m an officer
of twenty-three years seniority, which is more than De Long
has, and were we both on board a frigate I’d be very much
Mr. De Long’s senior. But here on the <em>Jeannette</em> he’s captain
and my superior, so I don’t feel it bears on me at all
that I have to ask his permission to come or go—it’s only a
custom of the Service. And there’s the skipper now,” I added
as De Long appeared on deck from the poop and stood blinking
a moment in the glare from the ice. “Think it over!”</p>

<p>But unfortunately for my clumsy efforts to pour oil on
the troubled waters, Collins’ eyes, gazing out over the ice,
happened to fall at that moment on the two little wood and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
canvas outhouses a ship’s length off the starboard beam,
which served officers and men as toilets, since frozen in as
we were, the regular ship’s “heads” on the <em>Jeannette</em> itself
had been placed out of commission. To these “heads” on the
ice all hands of course went freely as nature called. Collins’
eyes lighted up as he contemplated them. He faced me with
a queer grin.</p>

<p>“Well, chief, I’ll modify a bit what I just said about asking
permission to leave the ship. In such simple language
that he can’t possibly misunderstand, I’ll beg the captain’s
royal permission every time I have to visit the ‘head’ and I’m
going to start right now!” He turned aft toward the poop.</p>

<p>Amazed at Collins’ intended action, I grabbed his arm and
stopped him short.</p>

<p>“Look here, old man, none of that! Do you want to insult
the captain openly?”</p>

<p>Collins twisted out of my grip.</p>

<p>“What do you think he’s trying to do to me, chief? I’ll
merely be carefully obeying his order. By God, I’m going
to ask him to let me go on the ice right now!” He strode aft,
stopped before the skipper, saluted him elaborately.</p>

<p>What he said to De Long, I can only imagine, since I was
too far away to hear, but I judge he phrased his request in
about as plain old-fashioned Anglo-Saxon as it could be put,
for De Long, obviously startled, flushed a fiery red, retorted
angrily, and then turned on his heel.</p>

<p>And from that time forth, Mr. Collins and Captain De Long
remained separate in all things as much as they could, simply
carrying on the duties of the ship. And from that time also,
Collins, fancying offense to himself in almost every remark
made in the wardroom mess, withdrew more and more from
association with the rest of us, sticking only the more closely
to Newcomb, who as the sole other non-seagoing civilian
aboard, he may have considered as a sort of fellow victim.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">September passed, and the hoped-for gales which might
break up the pack and allow us to escape, or at least to work
into a winter harbor in distant Wrangel Land, failed to
materialize. October came and went in the same manner,
no real gales, no winds strong enough to have any effect
on the ice, nothing but daily gusts of fine snow which cut
our faces and spoiled our footing for exercise. Frozen in,
we went with the ice drift, in a general northwesterly direction,
till the rocky outline of Herald Island faded into
the hummocky horizon to the south, while our continued
failure to sight land to the westward made it less and less
likely every day that Wrangel Land stretched northward as
we had been led to expect. But we were not idle. After all,
our expedition was a scientific one. Aside from attempting
to reach the Pole, aside from discovering new lands in this
unexplored ocean, our major aim was to add to the world’s
knowledge of the Arctic seas, of the Arctic skies, of magnetic
phenomena, of meteorological information and of animal
life in the unknown north. For these purposes we were
the most elaborately equipped expedition which had ever
gone north. We carried two scientists and God only knew
what varieties of scientific instruments gathered from the
Smithsonian Institution and the Naval Hydrographic Office.</p>

<p>Since exploration and discovery were for the present out
of question, De Long turned to all hands intensively on these
scientific phases. On the ice a hundred yards from the ship
so as to be unaffected by the iron in her, we set up a canvas
observatory, with compass, dip circle, anemometer, rain-gauge,
barometer, pendulum, and a variety of thermometers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
Over the side, through a hole chopped in the thick ice, we
provided an opening for our dredge and our drift lead.
Hourly we took observations (and carefully recorded them)
of every type of phenomenon for which we were equipped
to measure—magnetic variation and dip, wind velocity and
direction, humidity, air pressure and temperature, gravity
readings, temperature of the sea at top, bottom, and points
in between, salinity of the sea water, speed and direction of
drift—all this data laboriously read night and day in the
Arctic chill went into our logs. And for the zoological and
botanical side of our expedition, all hands were directed to
bring in for Newcomb’s inspection specimens of anything
found on the ice, under, or above it, which meant that whatever
our guns could knock down in the form of birds or
beasts, or our hooks could catch in the way of fish, passed
under Newcomb’s scrutiny before (in most cases) they went
to Ah Sam and were popped into the galley kettles.</p>

<p>And to top off all in completing our polar records, we
brought along an extensive and expensive photograph outfit,
intending to get a continuous record of our life in the Arctic
and particularly some authentic views of Aurora Borealis.</p>

<p>So there being nothing else to compete with it for our
time, science received a double dose of attention, too much
in fact. Taking the multitude of readings every hour (there
were sixteen thermometers alone to be read) kept the watch
officer hopping, and as each of us, except Collins and Newcomb,
had ship and personnel matters to look after, it became
to a high degree a nuisance. Most of this scientific work
naturally should have fallen to Collins and Newcomb, but
unfortunately matters in their departments went none too
smoothly. The captain received a severe jolt when he learned
that the photographic outfit, entrusted to Collins’ care, was
practically useless because our meteorologist had neglected
when buying his photographic plates in San Francisco to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
get any developer for them and that not a picture he took
could be developed till we got back to civilization. When
on top of this, one of our barometers and some of our
precious thermometers entrusted also to Collins were carelessly
broken, the captain began to mistrust Collins as a
scientist and loaded a considerable part of the observation
work on Chipp, on Ambler, and on me—a development which
did not help to make any more amicable the attitude of
Collins towards his shipmates.</p>

<p>Speaking frankly, after two months’ close association in
the cabin of the <em>Jeannette</em>, we were beginning to get tired
of each other’s company. Life on shipboard is difficult at
best with the same faces at every meal, the same idiosyncrasies
constantly rubbing your nerves, the same shortcomings
of your messmates to irritate you; but ordinarily there
are compensations. Shore leave gets you away from your
shipmates, while foreign ports, foreign customs, foreign
scenes, and foreigners give flavor to a cruise that makes life
not only livable but to my mind rich in variety, and to a
person like myself, completely satisfying. But in the polar
ice, we came quickly to the realization that life on the
<em>Jeannette</em> was life on shipboard at its worst—a small cramped
ship, a captain who socially had retired into himself, only a
few officers, and not a solitary compensation. No possibility
of shore leave, no foreign ports—nothing but the limitless
ice pack holding us helpless and no hope of any change
(except for the worse) till summer came and released us.
And, impossible to conceal, a mental despondency, as ponderable
and as easily sensed as the cold pervading the ship
gripped our captain as we drifted impotently with the pack
between Herald Island and Wrangel Land, a thousand miles
from that Pole which in a blare of publicity from the <em>Herald</em>,
he had set out in such confidence to conquer.</p>

<p>Gone now were all the fine theories about the Kuro-Si-Wo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Current and the open path to the northward through the
Arctic Ocean that its warm waters would provide. We had
only to look over the side at the ice floes fifteen feet thick
gripping our hull to know that the “black tide” of Japan had
no more contact with these frozen seas than had the green
waters of the Nile. And just as thoroughly exploded was
that other delusion on which we had based our choice of
route—the Herr Doktor Petermann’s thesis that Wrangel
Land was a continent stretching northward toward the Pole
along the coasts of which with our dog teams we could
sledge our way over firm ground to the Pole. Every glimpse
we got of it as we drifted northwest with the pack for our
first eight weeks showed conclusively enough that Wrangel
Land was nothing more than a mountainous island to the
southward and not a very large island at that. As for Dr.
Petermann and his idea that Greenland stretched upward
across the Pole to reappear on the Siberian side as Wrangel
Land, if that ponderous German scientist who so dominated
current European opinion on polar matters could have been
forced to spend a week in our crow’s-nest observing how
insignificant a speck his much publicized Wrangel Land
formed of the Arctic scene, I am sure the result would have
been such a deflation of his ego and his reputation as might
be of great benefit at least to future explorers even if too
late to be of service to us in the <em>Jeannette</em>, already led astray
by the good doctor’s teachings.</p>

<p>How much the general knowledge amongst our officers
that every theory on which the expedition had been based
was false had to do with the lack of sociability and of harmony
among us, and how much of it may have been owing
simply to our physical imprisonment in the ice, I will not
venture to say. But in my mind, the belief of all that as a
polar exploring expedition we were already a failure, doomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
never to get anywhere near the Pole, had a decided, if an
unconscious, bearing on the reactions of all of us, and most
of all on the captain and on Collins, both of whom had
brought along massive blank journals whose pages they had
confidently expected to fill with the records of their discoveries.</p>

<p>The captain’s journal I sometimes saw, as each evening
around midnight he toiled over his entries. Instead of records
of new lands discovered, of the attainment of ever-increasing
latitudes exceeding those around 83° North reached by
the English through Baffin Bay and Smith Sound, how it
must have gnawed the captain’s heart that his entries had
to be confined to such items as my struggles with our distilling
apparatus, our difficulties with such newfangled
gadgets as telephones and electric generators, or the momentous
facts that Aneguin, Alexey, or Captain Dunbar
(as the case might be) had chased a polar bear (or perhaps
a walrus) which had been shot (or had escaped). All of these
happenings to De Long’s chagrin must be recorded as having
occurred in the low seventies, latitudes far to the south
of those reached even by the insignificant and ill-equipped
caravels of Dutch seamen three hundred years ago in their
explorations of Spitzbergen.</p>

<p>What Collins put in his journal, I never knew. But I can
well imagine how much it must have irked him, a newspaper
man accustomed to live in an atmosphere of printing presses
rumbling away over their grist of momentous world events
to be spread daily before the eager eyes of <em>Herald</em> readers,
to have nothing to record except perhaps his personal sense
of injustice. Yet put down something every day he did,
for I can still see him, his long drooping mustaches almost
sweeping the pages, religiously bending over the leather-bound
ledger every afternoon in his chilly cabin in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
<em>Jeannette’s</em> poop, pouring the bitterness of his soul onto
those pages, building up a record with which I doubt not
he hoped when we returned to civilization to blast De Long
out of the Service in disgrace.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">On November 6, two months to a day of our being
trapped in the pack, came the first break in the monotony
of our imprisonment. About four in the afternoon Collins,
trudging perhaps for the thousandth time the rough path to
the observatory across that hundred yards of ice which we
had come to regard as substantial as a Broadway sidewalk,
came pell-mell back to the ship and up the gangway into the
wardroom to startle us with the news that the pack ice had
cracked wide open between our ship and the observatory!
We rushed on deck and over the side. Sure enough it was so.
A little behind Dr. Ambler and the captain, I arrived at the
edge of the rent, over a yard wide already and continuously
growing wider. While we could still jump the gap, there was
a wild dash to get our precious instruments out of the observatory
and back across the opening to the ship, which
(all the officers taking a hand) we shortly accomplished
without mishap. That done, with varying emotions we
watched as over the next few hours the chasm widened, with
the dark sea water showing in strong contrast to the whiteness
of the snow-covered ice. But not for long did we see
really open water, for with the temperature far below zero,
the water which was welling up to within two feet of the
top of the parted edges of the floe promptly froze, even
though it was salt, into a sheet of young ice. The gap nevertheless
kept widening till by midnight it was perhaps ten
fathoms across.</p>

<p>What was causing the rupture? One man’s guess was as
good as another’s, and all were worthless, I suppose. There
was little wind, no land in sight for the edge of the pack to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
strand on, no evidence of pressure from any direction, and
plenty of water beneath us, for the soundings showed over
twenty fathoms to a soft mud bottom. Chipp’s surmise, that
a tidal action was responsible, was as good an explanation as
any. But what is not satisfactorily explainable is always fearsome,
and it was perhaps excusable that we looked with some
anxiety toward our ship and were secretly relieved to see
her as steady as Gibraltar there in the ice some fifty fathoms
off, still heeled as usual to starboard with her masts and spars
showing not even a quiver as they stood sharply outlined
against the frosty polar sky. And so the day ended.</p>

<p>But morning brought a different scene. During the night
from somewhere came a push on the pack which closed that
chasm, forcing the layer of young ice which had formed
over it up into broken masses on our floe. Then with all the
young ice squeezed out, the two parted edges of the original
pack came together under such great pressure that the advancing
sheet was shoved up over the edge of the floe holding
the ship, leaving broken masses seven to eight feet thick
strewn helter-skelter in a long ridge along the line of junction.</p>

<p>As an engineer, I regarded that broken ice with severe
misgivings. We fortunately were solidly frozen in, with our
thick floe spreading in all directions interposed as a buckler
between us and the pressing pack, but suppose our floe should
split and leave us exposed? Could any ship withstand a
squeeze in that Titan’s nutcracker? In spite of our thick
sides and reenforcing trusses, the sight of those eight foot
thick blocks of ice tumbled upon our floe was not reassuring.</p>

<p>On the <em>Jeannette</em>, men and officers alike questioningly
scanned the scene while slowly the hours drifted by and we
waited apprehensively in the silence of that Arctic morning
for what was next, and while we waited even what light
breeze there was died away to a perfect calm. Then without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
apparent reason and without warning, the gap in the ice
suddenly yawned open to a width of some five fathoms and
immediately down the canal thus formed, broken ice started
to flow in a groaning, shrieking mass that so shook the floe
in which the <em>Jeannette</em> was imbedded that to us there, only
a few yards away clinging to the rail of our ship, it appeared
each instant the sheet of ice protecting us must shatter and
the <em>Jeannette</em> herself be sucked in to join that swirling
maelstrom of hurtling ice cakes. Our eyes glued to the quaking
floe into which we were frozen, we watched it shiver
and throb under the battering of the broken blocks hurrying
by, inwardly speculating on how long it would stand up.
Occasionally I glanced furtively at the five sledges standing
on the poop, packed with over a month’s provisions for
men and dogs, ready at a moment’s notice to go over the
side should we have to abandon ship. But if our ship, torn
loose and caught in that mass of churning ice, was crushed
and sank, how could we ever get safely away from her with
our lives, let alone get clear those sledges carrying the food?</p>

<p>Five hours of that scene and of such thoughts we stood,
and then, thank God, the flow of ice stopped. The <em>Jeannette</em>
was unharmed. We were still safe. But how long a respite
would we have? Who knew? Evidently not our captain. As
I went below, worn and frozen, I heard him call out to our
executive officer,</p>

<p>“Knock off all regular ship’s work, Chipp. Turn to immediately
with all hands and make a couple of husky sledges
to carry our dinghies over that ice if we have to abandon
ship. And for God’s sake, shake it up!”</p>

<p>We got a day’s rest if one may call it that, while Nindemann,
Sweetman, and both watches toiled feverishly on the
sledges. Then came another day of strain, watching the moving
ice grinding and smashing at our floe, breaking it away
to within a hundred feet of us. Then a brief respite over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
night, only at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to have the motion start again worse
than ever.</p>

<p>This time, hell seemed to have broken loose. From the
pack came a noise the like of which I never heard before
on land or sea, in war or peace, sounding like the shrieking of
a thousand steamer whistles, the thunder of heavy artillery,
the roaring of a hurricane, and the crash of collapsing houses
all blended together as down that canal in the pack, a terrifying
sight to behold, came stupendous pieces of floe ice as
high as two and three story buildings. Sliding by crazily
upended, they churned and battered against each other and
against the thick edges of our floe with such unearthly
screeching and horrible groanings that my eardrums seemed
in a fair way to split under the impact of that sound!</p>

<p>Occasionally a berg would jam in the canal blocking the
current. With that, under the force of the ice pressing behind,
our floe would groan and heave up into waves till
several feet of its edge cracked off, easing the pressure and
relieving the jam—but each time leaving us with less and less
of the floe between us and disaster.</p>

<p>Half an hour of this in the dim light of the early dawn,
and then the movement ceased, leaving our tortured ears
and jumping nerves to return to normal as best they could
while the day broke. But our relief was considerably tempered
when in the better light we discovered that a new
crack had formed a little distance ahead across our bows
and that into this opening an advancing floeberg was being
driven along like a wedge towards our port side, threatening
to cut into the undisturbed pack there and leave us imbedded
in a tiny island of ice, to be exposed then to the wear
of churning bergs on both sides of us!</p>

<p>With no further noticeable movement of the pack, we
were left in peace to contemplate the possibilities of this
situation till late afternoon, when the main stream again got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
underway and bombarded our floe to starboard heavily for
four hours so strenuously that it seemed to all of us that this
time we must surely go adrift. But at about 8 p.m., the motion
ceased again, leaving us all in such a state of mind that the
captain’s order for all hands to sleep in their clothes with
knapsacks close at hand ready for instant flight, seemed to
us the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>We didn’t get much sleep. Hardly had the midwatch
ended, when little Newcomb, who unable to rest at all, had
in spite of the bitter cold stayed on deck till 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, darted
into De Long’s cabin, seized his shoulder, woke him with
a shout,</p>

<p>“Turn out, captain! It’s all over this time! That ice is
coming right down on us!”</p>

<p>De Long, already fully clothed, sprang from his bunk,
seized his knapsack, and rushed on deck. The rest of us in
the poop, none too sound asleep ourselves, were roused by
the noise and hurriedly followed him up to find that Newcomb
had hardly exaggerated.</p>

<p>On the starboard side, like buildings being poured through
a chute, the broken floes were cascading along the channel
at a livelier rate than ever, but that at least was hardly novel
to us now. What froze our blood as we stood there in the
cold light of the moon was the sight ahead. The rift in the
pack which yesterday was headed across our bows, had
changed direction squarely for our bowsprit, and now along
that opening was coming toward us irresistibly and steadily,
towering as high as our yardarms, a torrent of floebergs,
thundering down on the yet unbroken pack between with
a violence that made the sturdy <em>Jeannette</em> quiver under our
feet like jelly!</p>

<p>Hardly audible in the roaring of the ice, Jack Cole shrilled
away on his bosun’s pipe, then his hoarse voice bellowed
along the berth deck,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“All hands! Stand by to abandon ship!”</p>

<p>Our entire crew poured up from below to shiver in a
temperature of twenty below zero and shake, I have no doubt
for other good reasons, as they stood helpless round the
mainmast, all eyes riveted on that fearful wall of advancing
ice, with a crest of hummocks, weighing twenty to fifty
tons each, toppling forward like surf breaking on our floe.
Another crash, another startling advance of the floebergs,
and on top of the deckhouse I saw De Long suddenly grasp
the mainstay with both hands and hang on for dear life,
awaiting the final smash as that Niagara of ice struck us.</p>

<p>The blow never came. God alone knows why, but hardly
twenty-five feet from our bows, the onrushing wall of ice
suddenly halted, the pressure vanished, and we on the <em>Jeannette</em>
were left to contemplate, in the deathly Arctic silence
which ensued and in the growing light, the indescribable
wreckage that had been wrought in the level floe that had
once surrounded us. And then like a feeble anti-climax, the
stillness was broken by the whistling of the bosun’s pipe,
followed by his call,</p>

<p>“All hands! Lay below for breakfast!”</p>

<p>Breakfast? Who really wanted breakfast? What each of
us earnestly wished was only to be far to the south, away
from that dreaded pack ready to crush us, but seemingly delaying
the fatal moment as a cat delays, knowing that the
mouse with which it toys cannot get away.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Nothing else happened that day. Our dogs, which in the
face of disaster we had rounded up and penned inside the
bulwarks, where they relieved themselves by staging a continuous
battle, we now let loose and they joyously celebrated
their freedom in chasing each other over the broken ice.
Watching their antics was some relief, little though it might
be, to frayed nerves and helped take our imaginations off
what that broken ice threatened to our ship.</p>

<p>As a further distraction, we had a clear day and far to
the southward sighted mountains, which we made out to be
the familiar north coast of Wrangel Land, some sixty miles
away.</p>

<p>And that was all. The day which for us had dawned in
imminent peril, ended quietly with the <em>Jeannette</em> still frozen
in that two months old cradle of ice, still uncomfortably
heeled well over to starboard. We began to breathe more
freely.</p>

<p>We took no more meteorological observations, but so far
as I was concerned, I had more to do than before. Though
the fires were out in my boilers and all the machinery laid
up, at De Long’s direction I spent a great part of my time
below during this period continually scanning the sides and
the trusses for any signs of giving way, and inspecting the
bilges to see if the ship was making any water. Of such
troubles there were no indications, but I had constantly
while below to be wary of my head, for I found that the
banging of the ice shook down a good deal of loose matter
in the holds, and particularly in the bunkers.</p>

<p>November 13, one week from the day the pack first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
opened up on us and inaugurated our reign of terror, brought
new excitement. Sleeping as before in my clothes, I was
wakened at 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> by a loud crack which seemed to come
directly from our keel. I slid from my bunk, in the passage
outside bumped into the captain, and together we ran on
deck, there to meet Collins who, on the midwatch taking
the hourly temperature readings, had rushed over the side
and now was coming back aboard. He reported that there
was nothing new except a crack in the ice not over an inch
wide running out from our stem. This was disquieting, but
nothing else happened during the night and the daylight
hours passed quietly enough without further disturbance;
so much so that by afternoon the skipper (full of scientific
zeal and expecting apparently some days of peace) ordered
our meteorological instruments reinstalled in a temporary
observatory. This we accordingly erected on one of the
newly-formed hills of ice as far from the ship as we dared
but still, fairly close aboard our starboard side.</p>

<p>From the grumbling of the seamen at this task as they dug
into the flintlike ice for anchorage for the guys holding down
the canvas tent over the instruments, I would say that the
captain’s optimism was hardly shared by his crew, but that
was neither here nor there and by 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> when the twilight
faded and night fell, the job was done.</p>

<p>Chipp took the first sets of readings. At eight o’clock,
after supper, I relieved him, to trek over the broken ice and
by the dim light of an oil lantern inside that flapping tent,
read the dip circle, the barometer, the anemometer, and a
varied assortment of thermometers. All the time as I struggled
for footing on the rough ice pinnacle I wondered what
earthly good it all was, considering the negligible chances
of any of this data ever being returned home for scientific
minds to study.</p>

<p>At 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, I turned the job over to the captain (who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
staying up anyway the while he wrote in his journal, ordinarily
took the readings till midnight when Collins relieved
him), and as was now my habit after a week of alarms, I
turned in with my fur boots on, earnestly hoping to get some
sleep to make up for the past week’s wear and tear.</p>

<p>Till 11 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, De Long in his cabin scratched away industriously
at his journal. Then six bells struck, he dropped his
pen, drew on his parka, and went over the side to take the
hourly observations.</p>

<p>Being the commanding officer, and not one of his subordinates
(in whom such an appreciation of the beauties of
nature at the expense of punctuality in observations might
have seemed a fault), De Long on his way to the observatory
paused a few moments to stand on an ice hummock and admire
a splendid auroral exhibition, a magnificent prismatic
arch to the northward, filling the sky from east to west and
reaching almost to the zenith. The beauty of this phenomenon
was no longer a novelty to any of us, but still he
stood awestruck in the silent night drinking in that soundless
electrical play of colored light, when he heard behind him
a crisp crackling as one of our dogs walking on the snow.
Turning, he saw to his surprise no dog but instead two men,
our so-called “anchor watch,” racing down the starboard
gangway and over the ice to our stern.</p>

<p>Both the aurora and the still unread instruments were forgotten
as the captain ran immediately for the bow. To his
astonishment, there he found the ice pack peaceably floating
away from our port side, leaving it completely exposed with
open water lapping our hull for the first time in months!</p>

<p>And as he watched in dazed amazement, the gap opened
so that in a few minutes we had alongside the <em>Jeannette</em> thirty
fathoms of rippling water in which was gorgeously reflected
the northern lights (a detail the beauty of which I think our
captain now took little note). The split in the pack was as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
clean and as straight along our fore and aft centerline as if
a giant hand had cut the ice with our keel, leaving the ship
still imbedded in the starboard floe toward which she heeled.
Meanwhile the port side pack, intact even to the bank of
snow which had built up above our gunwales, was sliding
noiselessly away to the northward, carrying with it, still
asleep, three of our dogs who had bedded themselves down
in its white crust!</p>

<p>A glimpse at our heeled over clipper bow and at our bowsprit
thrusting forward over his head, quickened De Long
into action. Nothing visible now remained to hold that tilted
ship from sliding any second out of her bed and into open
water! Back aboard he rushed, and once more the quiet of
the night was torn by the whistling of the bosun’s pipe and
Cole’s hoarse cry,</p>

<p>“All hands! Shake a leg! On deck wid yez!”</p>

<p>And again no sleep, as hastily in the darkness we hurried
our meteorological instruments back aboard, struck the observatory
we had so laboriously rigged only a few hours
before, chased on board all the dogs we could catch, rigged
out our dinghies and our other boats for immediate lowering,
dug our steam-cutter out of the ice alongside and hoisted
it aboard, ran in our gangway, and lastly rigged out a fall
for lowering provisions over the side and into the boats.</p>

<p>That all this, on the sloping deck of the <em>Jeannette</em>, was
done in the darkness at fifteen below zero and completed by
midnight in less than an hour, indicates what speed and
strength fear gave to our fingers and our feet. For the men
tumbling up from below had to look but once at the precarious
perch to which the <em>Jeannette</em> clung to send them
flying to their tasks.</p>

<p>Midnight came.</p>

<p>Our work done, we stood by in the inhuman cold momentarily
expecting to feel the ship lurch under our feet, slide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
suddenly off into the water, and without rudder, without
steam, and without sails go adrift in the darkness in that ever
widening rift in the parted pack.</p>

<p>After an hour of this, with nothing happening to relieve
the strain, the tension became almost unbearable. De Long,
looking over the silent groups of fur-clad seamen clustered
there on deck alongside the boats, ordered Ah Sam to fire
up the galley range and serve out hot coffee to the men, hot
tea to the officers. He then told Cole to pipe down, but with
all hands to stay in their clothes, ready for any call. So we
lay below, but I doubt if anyone had much better luck than
I getting to sleep again.</p>

<p>There was no need for reveille in the morning. The first
streaks of light found the whole crew from Irish bosun to
Chinese cook lining the bulwark, staring off to port. I
climbed the bridge to get clear of the snarling dogs. There
before me, already ensconced in the port wing was the
skipper, rubbing his glasses to clear them of frost for a better
view.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it, chief?” asked De Long, nodding
in the direction of the distant pack.</p>

<p>I squinted off to port. A thin skin of young ice, possibly
four inches thick, had formed over the exposed water. Across
that, perhaps five hundred to a thousand yards away, was
the bank of snow which the day before had been piled up
against our bulwark.</p>

<p>“Well, captain, it’s a quarter of a mile off anyway,” I
answered. “Maybe more.” From the overhanging wing of
the bridge I glanced curiously down on our inclined side,
exposed now for the first time in months. Near the waterline,
still looking fresh and bright, were those gouges in our
elm doubling we had received in early September while butting
and ramming a way through that twisting lead into the
pack. Looking at those battle scars, I wished fervently that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
we had had less luck that day in battering our way in. But
that was a subject the rights and wrongs of which were now
never discussed among the officers. Instead, scanning our
listed masts and our unsupported port side, I asked,</p>

<p>“What in the name of all that’s holy is keeping us from
sliding clear?”</p>

<p>“God knows, I don’t,” replied De Long solemnly. “I just
can’t figure it out. When one side of our ice cradle slides
away from us without so much as taking with it any splinters
from our hull, it makes my theory that our planking’s solidly
frozen to the ice on our starboard side seem crazy. For why
should the ice attach itself so firmly to the planking on one
side, and to the other side not at all? It’s beyond me, Melville,
why we don’t slide off.” He adjusted the furry edge
of the hood of his parka around his eyeglasses, peered down
a second at the scarred side below him, then while his glasses
were still bright and clear, stared off toward the wall of snow
topping the edge of the departed pack and finally nodded
his head as if agreeing with my estimate of its distance.</p>

<p>Looking worn and haggard, for if possible our captain had
had even less sleep than any of us during the past week,
De Long finished his examination, eyed for a long time his
crew stretched out below us along the rail, then turned
to me,</p>

<p>“Melville, you’re older than I. In the late war you were
at sea fighting the rebels when I was still a midshipman, and
you’ve been through lots besides. So I feel I can talk to you,
and lean on you as on no one else on this ship, and God
above us knows, I need someone here to lean on! Every
morning I pray to Him for our safety, every night I give
thanks to Him for our escapes during the day. But here in
the Arctic, God seems so distant, and this steady strain on
my mind is fearful! Look at my men below there, look at
my ship! Neither my men nor my ship are secure for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
second, and yet I can’t take a single step for their security.
A crisis may come any moment to bring us face to face with
death—and all I can do is to be thankful in the morning that
it has not come during the night, and at night that it has not
come since the morning! And that’s the Arctic exploration
I’ve brought them on! Living over a powder keg with the
fuse lighted, waiting for the explosion, would be a similar
mode of existence! Melville, it’s hardly bearable!” And then
looking down again at the crew, he muttered wearily,</p>

<p>“But I’ve got to keep on bearing it. Call me if anything
happens, chief. So long as we’re still hanging on here, I’ll try
to get some sleep now.” With sagging shoulders eloquently
proclaiming his utter exhaustion, he slumped down the ladder
and off the bridge, leaving me alone, figuratively to add an
“Amen” to his estimate of our situation.</p>

<p>For over a week, the listing <em>Jeannette</em>, which looked as if
the pressure of a little finger would send her tumbling out
of her inclined bed, nevertheless clung to her half cradle in
the pack, defying apparently all the principles of physical
force so far as I as an engineer understood them.</p>

<p>On the third day after the pack separated, we had a bad
southeast gale blowing all night and all day, with terrific
squalls at times reaching a velocity of fifty miles an hour.
Although that wind hit us squarely on the starboard bow, its
most favorable angle for casting us adrift, the <em>Jeannette</em> held
grimly to her berth and nothing happened. Then on the fifth
day, urged on by a northerly blow, the floebergs again got
underway, broke up the young ice to port of us, and jammed
themselves under our bows with heavy masses of ice pressing
directly on the stem. We confidently looked to see the
ship knocked clear this time, but evidently other floebergs
jammed against our exposed side exerted such a heavy beam
pressure that we stayed in place, though the poor <em>Jeannette</em>,
squeezed both ahead and abeam, groaned and creaked continuously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
under the stresses on her strained timbers. The sixth
day, the seventh day, and the eighth day, we had more of
the same, with streams of floebergs bombarding our exposed
port side, and on the starboard side our floe steadily dwindling
under the impact of the bergs hurtling through the
canal there.</p>

<p>Life on the <em>Jeannette</em> became almost impossible. Sleeping
with our clothes on, jumping nervously from our bunks at
every sudden crackling in the ship’s timbers, at each unexpected
crash of the bergs outside, we got slight rest for our
bodies and none at all for our nerves. And in the middle of
all this, the sun disappeared below the horizon for good,
leaving us to face what might come in the continuous gloom
of the long Arctic night. According to Danenhower’s calculations,
we could expect the sun to rise again in seventy-one
days, unless meanwhile we drifted farther to the northward,
in which case of course our night would be still further
prolonged.</p>

<p>On the ninth day since the separation of the pack, the
wind rose once more, blowing directly on our starboard
beam, and the never-ceasing stream of bergs began again to
pile up across our stem, for us an ominous combination.</p>

<p>On the tenth day, fearing the worst, we rounded up all
our dogs, and waited. The pressure ahead increased, with
floating ice piling up along the port side higher than our rail,
finally starting the planking in our bulging bulwarks. Under
the bowsprit, the rising ice blotted from sight our figurehead.
Then an upended floeberg crashed violently into the
pack under our starboard bow and wedged its way relentlessly
toward our side. The pressure became tremendous.
Beneath our feet the <em>Jeannette’s</em> tortured ribs groaned dismally.
On deck we looked silently at one another, waiting.
Something was going to collapse this time. Which would give
way first, ship or ice?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly the <em>Jeannette</em> lifted by the stern, shifted a little
in her cradle. Instantly the floeberg under our starboard bow
drove forward, split our floe, and with a lurch and a heavy
roll to port we slid into open water, afloat and undamaged,
on an even keel once more!</p>

<p>Intensely relieved at having got clear without being
crushed, we nevertheless looked back sadly, as we drifted
off among the floebergs, at the shattered remnants of the ice
cradle which for two and a half months had sheltered us, to
see it now tumbling about in elephantine masses, no longer
a haven of refuge in our trials.</p>

<p>Well, we were afloat. It was at least some consolation to
have a level deck beneath our feet while we waited, sailors
with no control whatever over our ship, for what next the
ice pack had in store for us.</p>

<p>But the pack gave us a respite. Idly we drifted about in
a wide bay of broken ice, stopping for a brief time alongside
one floe, then drifting off till stopped by another. The wind
moderated, the temperature rose somewhat till it stood near
zero, and finally it began to snow. There being no signs of
imminent danger, the captain ordered the bosun to pipe down
and we went below, permitted at last to eat a meal without
having the plates threaten to slide each instant off the table.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">What next?</p>

<p>I had thought that our experiences so far had sufficiently
numbed my nerves to enable me to stand anything further
with comparative calm, but I had underestimated the ice pack.</p>

<p>During the night after our going afloat nothing happened
as we drifted, but by early morning of the next day, November
25, we were once more in action, fighting the pack for
our existence.</p>

<p>At six a.m., as a preliminary, drifting ice pressed us against
the edge of the pack and piled high up against our side,
nipping our port bow. An hour or so later, this developed
into a heavy squeeze which started more of our bulwark
planking, and listed us sharply to port. At this, coming while
we were at breakfast, things commenced to look bad and
we began to shuffle nervously in our chairs, all hands eyeing
the exit to the poop, but Danenhower tried to ease the mental
strain for us when, bending down to retrieve his spoon which
for the third time had rolled off the sloping table to the deck,
he remarked,</p>

<p>“Well, mates, if you’ve been itching for the good old days,
now’s your chance to cheer. With this heel, the <em>Jeannette’s</em>
beginning to feel to me like the old home again!”</p>

<p>But nobody laughed, and when after an hour of that
ticklish heel, the pressure slacked and we leveled off, no one
regretted the missing list, unnatural as its absence now felt
to us.</p>

<p>Coming up on deck after a hasty breakfast, we found ourselves
adrift again near one end of a narrow lead of water
perhaps a couple of miles long, at the far end of which appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
a sizeable open bay. De Long debated earnestly with
both Chipp and Dunbar, whether he ought to attempt to run
out an ice-anchor and make fast to a floe, though the question
was largely academic for never did a large enough floe come
near us.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon with still no decision, the question
was settled for us when a strong current springing up for
some unknown reason, the rudderless ship began to drift stern
first down that canal in the pack. At the same time the broken
ice behind us also got underway and started to follow, bearing
down ominously for our bows.</p>

<p>We moved along with increasing speed, to our deep relief
steadily gaining on the broken floes pursuing us, till unfortunately
at a bend in the canal, our stern took the bank
and stopped us dead. At this, with our rudder post anchored
in the floes, it seemed as if we were caught, when De Long
sang out happily,</p>

<p>“Look! Her bow is paying round as prettily as if she were
casting under jibs!” and to our surprise, it was so. Our stem
swung through a complete arc of 180°, our stern drifted clear
of the ice, and there we were, wholly without effort on our
part, properly headed downstream with the current!</p>

<p>But even that slight delay while coming about promptly
put us in difficulties. As our stern drifted free of the bank,
the oncoming ice struck us and we were jammed through
that canal to an accompaniment of tumbling and shrieking
masses of ice awful to contemplate. Huge hummocks, tons
in weight, overhung our bulwarks, threatening to break off
and crash down on our decks; floebergs large as churches
bobbed up and down alongside like whales, seemingly about
to come aboard and overwhelm us, time after time leaving
us breathless as huddled inboard round the mainmast we
watched, not daring to go near the rail, even more afraid
to seek shelter below. Helpless, the <em>Jeannette</em> was pushed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
rammed, squeezed, and hammered along amidst the screeching
of the floes. Just as helpless, we stood in the Arctic night
thankful nevertheless for the bright moonlight which at mid-afternoon
was flooding the scene, for had we without that
moon been in darkness forced to stand by and listen to that
shrieking ice without being able to see, God alone knows
what effect terror would have had on us!</p>

<p>This hair-raising passage lasted half an hour. Then as suddenly
as our ordeal had started, it ended in the midst of an
eruption of ice cakes by our being spewed from a final jam
blocking the canal into a large open bay where the current,
with room to spread at last, quickly lost speed, and the terrifying
floebergs, no longer constricted, fell slowly away from
our sides!</p>

<p>With fervent sighs of relief at our deliverance we saw the
battered <em>Jeannette</em> lose headway, float gently toward the wide
floe forming the southerly bank of the bay, and quietly ram
her blunt nose into the young ice there, bringing up without
a tremor and holding fast. So ended our day.</p>

<p>It was getting along toward the end of November. For
three days after that, we lay against the edge of the bay
while the young ice thickened about us and a heavy southeast
gale kicked up. Our useless masts and spars whipped and
rattled in the squalls, our rigging, swollen to two or three
times natural size by coatings of frost, sang in the wind in a
deep bass pitch wholly new to us, and the ship shook in the
gusts as if her sticks were going to be torn clean out of her.
But to us as sailors none of this was wholly novel; our only
anxiety was what effect this gale, the worst we had yet seen
in the Arctic, would have on the pack. We chopped a hole in
the young ice alongside, got a lead line down, and soon observed
that the whole pack was drifting to leeward with the
wind, moving to the northwest apparently into a large water
space temporarily existing unseen by us somewhere there in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
the Arctic Sea. These drift observations gave us cause for
sober thought. What would happen if, with the gale still
blowing to urge the ice northwest, something across its path
brought the pack to a stand?</p>

<p>We soon found out. On the third day of the storm, in the
dim light of a moon just rising in the morning, we saw the
leeward ice commence to move past the ship, paradoxically
going to windward. Whatever it was, something <em>had</em> brought
the drifting pack to a sudden halt, but the gale still howled
on, driving to the northwest, and unfortunately for us as we
lay broadside to it, driving the ice to windward fairly onto
our port beam, dead against our framing. We were in for
another squeezing by the pack.</p>

<p>Before long the <em>Jeannette</em>, with the pressure squarely on
her ribs, caught now between opposing floes extending her
entire length, was quivering and snapping worse I think than
ever in our experience. Our spar deck arched up under the
strain, pitch and oakum were squeezed out of the seams, and
a bucket full of water standing on a hatch on the poop was
half emptied of its contents by the constant agitation.</p>

<p>To leeward of us, where the ice appeared weaker, one
sheet rode up over another and against this double thickness
of ice our starboard side jammed, while the port floe (which
for some reason seemed stronger than the ice to leeward)
pressed fiercely against us there. The <em>Jeannette</em> thus gripped,
shivered and groaned dismally and her decks bulged upwards
till the heavy athwartship trusses in her hull below came into
play and took the squeeze directly. When the ship was able
to give no further, the noise ceased, and for half an hour
perhaps with only the trembling of the decks to indicate the
struggle, the pack pressed and the <em>Jeannette</em> resisted while
we as helpless spectators waited the outcome.</p>

<p>Suddenly the port floe humped and crumbled, relieving the
thrust. Our sprung decks flattened out to normal; we gasped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
in relief. But our thankfulness was premature as it turned out,
for piling its broken edges higher against our side, the port
floe, driven in by the wind, pushed up for another nip and
the whole performance was immediately repeated with the
<em>Jeannette</em> in a few minutes as badly squeezed as before.</p>

<p>For eight solid hours the <em>Jeannette</em> fought the pack, over a
dozen times seemingly compressed to the point of collapse,
only to have the floe ice crumple up first and let her spring
back into shape each time. There was nothing we could do
to aid her—as De Long put it, it was simply a question of the
ice going through her or of her being strong enough to stand
it. She was strong enough, which was all we could say, and
when at last in the late afternoon the gale died down, the
pressure ceased and she was still intact, we said it fervently.
A good ship, the Arctic Steamer <em>Jeannette</em>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">December, 1879, our fourth month in the pack, came in with
crisp cold weather; and as the days passed with the ice about
us thickening and the pack showing signs of some stability,
we began again to breathe without the subconscious dread
that each minute was to be our last. After a few days thus,
we even settled into the winter routine of the ship, released
our dogs, and commenced to take some interest in the
wonders of the Arctic night.</p>

<p>For a month, under the shadow of death, personalities had
been forgotten, personal idiosyncrasies submerged. Now with
the easing of that strain, our likes and dislikes, our personal
vanities, and the ordinary problems of existence in the Arctic,
popped up once more.</p>

<p>De Long began to worry over scurvy. No Arctic expedition
previously of which we had knowledge had been free
of it; in many of them, scurvy, even more than ice, had been
responsible for their tales of horrible suffering, death, and
disaster. Overmuch salt was apparently the cause of scurvy;
proper diet, proper water, and proper exercise were the antidotes
prescribed by Dr. Ambler, and De Long plunged vigorously
into a program designed to protect us from that loathsome
disease.</p>

<p>Exercise to fortify our bodies, the easiest of the requisites
to provide, received immediate attention. On December 2,
after the first night in weeks during which the captain felt
secure enough to take off his clothes when turning in, came
a new order.</p>

<p>We were lounging round the messroom, hungrily waiting
for breakfast while Tong Sing padded about between pantry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
and table, setting out the oatmeal, the coffee, and the thick
slices of bread when the door from the captain’s stateroom
swung back, and with a grave,</p>

<p>“Good morning, gentlemen,” in came De Long, holding a
paper in his hand.</p>

<p>“Good morning, captain,” we replied in a ragged chorus,
and hardly waiting till the skipper had seated himself, slid
into our chairs. As usual, I lifted the cover of the oatmeal
dish and started to serve.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute with that, Melville; I want to read this
order.” The captain adjusted his glasses, stroked his mustaches
a moment while scanning what he had written, then in his
scholarly manner read,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Until the return of spring, and on each day without
exception when the temperature is above thirty degrees
below zero, the ship will be cleared regularly by all hands
from eleven a.m. till one p.m. During this period every
officer and man will leave the ship for exercise on the ice,
which should be as vigorous as possible. No one except the
officer entering the noon observations in the log will for
any purpose during this period return to the ship.</p>

<p class="right">
(Signed) <span class="smcap" style="padding-right: 1em">George Washington De Long,</span><br>
Commanding.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>De Long as he finished, passed the paper to the executive
officer on his right, and ordered crisply,</p>

<p>“Chipp, have all the officers initial this now, and then publish
it to the crew at quarters.” In a more conversational tone,
he added to us, “I suppose, gentlemen, the order’s obvious
enough. We’ve got to go and get some exercise or we’ll all
stagnate in this darkness and make it easier for scurvy to get
us. I’ve chosen the time when at least there’s a little twilight,
even though the sun’s gone. Does anybody have any suggestions
regarding exercises?”</p>

<p>The paper (together with Chipp’s pencil) passed back and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
forth across the table as one after another, starting with Chipp,
we initialed the order, but no one had any comments to make.
Once more I started to dish out the oatmeal. Danenhower, at
the foot of the table, signing last, tossed the sheet of paper
to Tong Sing, who shuffling across the wardroom, with an
Oriental bow laid it down before the captain.</p>

<p>“Here, Chipp, take this to read to the crew,” said the
skipper, starting to push it toward the exec, then on second
thought, holding it an instant while his eyes glanced perfunctorily
down the column of initials below his signature.
A deep flush came over his cheeks as he read and he stiffened
a little in his chair, but without looking up, he announced
sternly,</p>

<p>“Mr. Collins, I see you failed to sign this. What’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>There was an instant of tension, then,</p>

<p>“Collins isn’t here yet, captain,” put in Chipp swiftly.
“He’s often late for breakfast. Thinks that having to take the
observations on the midwatch is such a strain, he’s got to
sleep in every morning to recuperate, I guess. I’d tell him
later.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I forgot that Mr. Collins is not usually with us
for breakfast.” The skipper’s flush faded, he finished pushing
the order to Chipp. “Very well, have him sign when he
shows up. Now with respect to the exercise for the crew,
Chipp, serve out a couple of footballs. They may want to
play. And tell them that anyone who wishes can get permission
to take a rifle and go hunting.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” Chipp folded the order, shoved it into his
jacket. “But I’m not so keen on that hunting business, captain.
Skulking around through all these broken hummocks,
the men’ll be shooting each other or the dogs, thinking that
they’re bears or seals or something. It always happens.”</p>

<p>“I won’t shed any tears over the dogs, anyway,” growled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
Dunbar. “I think shooting a couple of dozen of ’em ‘by mistake’
would be a good thing!”</p>

<p>“Belay that, Dunbar, you wouldn’t be so heartless,” piped
up Danenhower. “Don’t destroy my last boyhood illusion.
What would life in the Arctic be without our dogs, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Still hell, Dan, if you ask me, either with or without ’em,”
replied the ice-pilot grimly, passing his plate to me for oatmeal.
“But getting back to the question of exercise, cap’n, I
think letting the men hunt’s a fine idea. Surprising how far a
man goes thinking that at the <em>next</em> waterhole he’ll surely get
a seal!”</p>

<p>The surgeon laughed softly.</p>

<p>“He’ll be surprised all right if he goes with you, Dunbar,”
drawled Ambler. “I’ve done it and I know. Every time you
say a thing’s a mile away across this ice, the only reason it
isn’t two miles off is because it’s three. The men’ll be surprised
all right if you take them hunting.”</p>

<p>Virginian and Yankee, the doctor and the ice-pilot were
off again on their favorite argument, Dunbar’s gross underestimation
of the distances he covered on his many scouting
trips over the ice. But I had another problem on my mind,
and as soon as I had washed down my oatmeal with the hot
coffee (which by now Danenhower had managed to get Ah
Sam to turn out as a strong black concoction) I went on deck
to struggle with my distilling apparatus.</p>

<p>Historically, there is no doubt that scurvy, the seaman’s
curse since the days of Noah’s voyage in the <em>Ark</em>, has
always resulted on long cruises from the absence of fresh
vegetables, the over-abundance of salt beef, and the impure
water (contaminated from the bilges) which marked the sailor’s
diet. And no one who has ever seen the swollen joints,
the rotting teeth, the hemorrhages under the skin, and the
bloated faces of the victims, but strains to fight shy of scurvy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
as a shipmate.</p>

<p>Fresh vegetables, the first defense against this scourge, we
could only carry in limited degree when we left San Francisco,
and they had long since been exhausted. Of canned
vegetables, especially tomatoes, we had a considerable supply
and on these we leaned heavily as an antidote. Then of
course we had three barrels of lime-juice, the specific remedy
introduced in 1795 by Sir Gilbert Blake with such good
results in the British Navy that ever since then the British
tars, forced to drink the stuff regularly, have been called in
derision “limeys” by their Yankee cousins. But in spite of all
this we did not feel safe. Other Arctic expeditions within the
last fifty years, as strongly fortified as we with lime-juice
and in some cases as well supplied with canned vegetables,
had before the end of a winter in the ice found scurvy
decimating them in spite of their precautions.</p>

<p>We were fitted out with copies of every printed record
of polar exploration that either in the United States or in
Europe, Bennett or his satellites on the <em>New York Herald</em>
could lay hands on. And De Long, a good student if the
Navy ever produced one, spent hours in his cabin poring
over the accounts of his contemporaries and his predecessors
in the ice puzzling out that riddle. Why in spite of lime-juice
and canned vegetables, in spite of pure fresh water daily
replenished from melting ice, had even our immediate rivals
in the race to the Pole still fallen prey to scurvy?</p>

<p>Their books gave no answer, but our experiences in getting
water by melting ice from the floebergs round us soon gave
us a clue. We had been led to believe that when sea water
froze under very low temperatures, the salt in it crystallized
out, rose to the freezing surface as an efflorescence, and was
washed or blown away, leaving the ice free of salt and fit to
be melted into good drinking water. Indeed Dr. Kane, whose
words at that time were accepted as gospel truth on all matters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
Arctic, had written,</p>

<p>“Ice formed at a temperature of -30° Fahrenheit will yield
a perfectly pure and potable element.”</p>

<p>And confirming this, Lieutenant Weyprecht, of the Austrian
expedition which in latitude 81° N. had discovered
Franz Josef Land only a few years ago, said that they found
that ice over “a certain thickness” yielded a pure water.</p>

<p>We were confident therefore when we entered the pack
that we needed only to send out a party with pick-axes to
obtain from the nearest convenient spot on the floe an abundant
supply of fresh water for drinking, cooking, and washing
purposes. But we were unpleasantly surprised to discover
that we could find not a particle of ice anywhere, whether
cut from the top, the bottom, or the middle of the floe,
whether taken from old floes fifteen feet thick or young ice
a foot thick, that did not contain from twenty to thirty times
as much salt per gallon as even the poorest water Dr. Ambler
felt he could safely allow our men to drink continuously.</p>

<p>During our initial few weeks in the pack we regarded this
situation with incredulity, the same incredulity I have no
doubt that the medieval alchemist displayed when his dabbling
revealed a fact failing to conform to the principles of
matter set forth by the master, Aristotle—it simply could not
be so! We concluded at first that perhaps the ice immediately
around us had not been formed at low enough temperatures,
or that it had not yet had time to reach that
“certain thickness.” But having nevertheless to get drinking
water the while we waited for temperature and time to form
round us the pure ice for our permanent supply, we were
reduced to scouting far and wide over the floes, scraping
together from drifts here and there enough snow to melt up
for our minimum needs.</p>

<p>But as 1879 faded into 1880, we drifted to the northward,
and the Arctic winter struck us in all its cold fury, we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
given a choice opportunity to try to our hearts’ content ice
of every thickness, formed under every temperature from
barely freezing down to -60° F., and we could no longer
blink the facts. On this matter, the masters from Dr. Kane
to Lieutenant Weyprecht were about as reliable as a lot of
gabbling old witches—what they said simply was not so!</p>

<p>In the absence of any startling geographical discoveries or
of any marked progress toward the Pole, that we had exploded
a third Arctic fallacy (those respecting the Kuro-Si-Wo
Current and Wrangel Land being the first two) gave
to Captain De Long and Dr. Ambler a sense of having accomplished
something at last. For Dr. Ambler deduced from
the observed fact that all floe ice retained some salt, the
mystery of the scurvy problem in previous expeditions.
These, using floe ice more or less mixed either with pure
snow or ice formed from melting snow, had obtained water
passably potable but actually (though their fixed misconceptions
kept them ignorant of it) containing so much salt that
in spite of lime-juice rations and what-have-you in the way
of canned vegetables, the scurvy had struck them down.</p>

<p>That deduction made it simple for us. All we had to do
was to avoid the use of tainted floe ice and we would be
the first Arctic expedition in history to dodge the scurvy.
And in case the <em>Jeannette</em> Expedition discovered nothing else,
to bring that discovery back home would at least salve in
some measure our pride as explorers.</p>

<p>But if we were not to use the floes, where then was our
water to come from? The obvious answer seemed to be from
carefully selected snowdrifts, but as we floated north with
the pack, we learned the futility of that. The drifts we relied
on for the first weeks after we entered the pack were soon
used up and Nature never replenished them. Apparently off
the north coast of Siberia in the early fall it snowed, but as
we drifted to the north of Wrangel Land and the temperature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
falling far below zero, stayed there, to our dismayed
astonishment we learned that in the ordinary sense it never
snowed where we were! Apparently the intense cold froze
all the vapor out of the atmosphere, leaving such a trifling
percentage in the dry air that regardless of other favorable
conditions for a fine snowfall, there just wasn’t enough moisture
to provide the makings. The result was that in a gale
when a temperature change brought snow, all that fell was a
fine powdery deposit, ice mainly, which driven by the wind
cut into our faces like needles. What was worse for us however
(for in most cases we could stay inboard during a blow)
was that the gale drove these particles over the pack with
such force that they acted like a sand blast on the surface
of the floes, with the net result that when the wind died,
such drifts as we could find were so complete a mixture of
powdered floe and driven snow as to be heavily salted and
wholly unfit for human needs.</p>

<p>Now, while we could find no newly formed safe drifts,
it had not been wholly impossible for us to get sufficient
good snow from the old ones by going further and further
afield in the pack until the last gale in November. This after
making us “shoot the rapids” so to speak in that canal, had
left us stranded miles from our original refuge in a pack of
what was mostly relatively young ice. Naturally there were
no old drifts in that vicinity and the captain, at first fearful
of being torn away at any minute, was reluctant to permit
anyone to get out of sight of the ship in searching for snow.
Willy-nilly, therefore, we got our water by scraping the tops
of nearby drifts formed in the last storm. This was so salty,
however, that within two days Dr. Ambler had several of
the officers and most of the crew under treatment for diarrhoea.
Aside from the ordinary effects of this disorder in
reducing the vitality of those afflicted, to us it was especially
disastrous, for since the “heads” on the ship were for obvious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
reasons shut up, we had for months been using portable
“heads” made of tenting, set up on the ice some little distance
from the ship. It needs little imagination therefore to understand
what diarrhoea meant to a man under the frequent
necessity of hastily rushing off through the Arctic night to
a flimsy canvas tent to sit there in the bitter cold of a temperature
some thirty degrees or more below zero.</p>

<p>Given a few weeks of such excessive salinity in our water
and it was obvious that scurvy would get us, but that at
least would take several weeks. De Long was faced with the
imperative necessity of rectifying the situation within a few
days or of risking the loss of his crew as a result of the unavoidable
physical exposure which diarrhoea entailed under
our peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p>De Long, Ambler, Chipp, and I held an ambulant council
of war. Muffled in our parkas, we first searched the pack
around us for suitable snowdrifts in the forlorn hope that
perhaps the men had missed a good one. We found a few
that to the taste seemed passable, but in each case the hope
faded when the surgeon squeezed a drop of silver nitrate into
a melted sample, and inevitably the milky white reaction
showed excessive salt.</p>

<p>Not very hopefully we scanned the “head” situation. No
chance of improvement there. Since the ship was immovably
frozen into the ice, we dared neither to reopen the “heads”
on the ship nor bring the ones on the floe any closer to the
gangway without risking an outbreak of contagion.</p>

<p>So there being no safe water available from the pack ice,
no hope of getting any from snowfalls, and the absolute need
of providing some quickly lest the next movement of the ice
find us with a helpless crew unable even to abandon ship,
it was the conclusion of the council that, regardless of cost,
we must make our own from sea water. Naturally enough
since I was engineer officer, De Long turned that problem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
over to me.</p>

<p>Ordinarily it would not have been much of a problem
technically. On the ship steaming normally, and feeding her
boilers from the sea, I might have bled some steam off the
auxiliary line, put it through a distilling coil or worm we had
fitted in our engine room, and collected the resulting fresh
water. But we were not only not steaming normally, we were
not steaming at all, because for the reasons I have given previously
our fires were out, our firerooms were cold, and our
boilers were emptied.</p>

<p>Aside from that, there was another angle to it that griped
the captain. To take sea water and distill it over into fresh
water you’ve got to boil it. That takes heat, and heat takes
coal, and coal was of all things we had aboard the most precious,
more so even than food, for in a pinch with our food
exhausted we might go out on the pack with rifles and knock
down bears, seals, and walruses enough to exist on, but where
in those icy wastes could we go to knock down even one ton
of coal to feed our boilers when our bunkers were emptied?
For we had left only ninety tons, which (save for the scanty
supply I doled out to Ah Sam daily for cooking, and to Bosun
Cole for stoking the two stoves forward and aft to keep
men and officers from freezing to death) under the captain’s
orders I was religiously husbanding, so that if ever we were
released by the pack, we might be able again to fire up our
boilers and do some of that exploring for which we had
come north.</p>

<p>Up to now, to live at all, we had had to burn coal enough
to run the galley and our heating stoves; from now on, if we
were to live without scurvy, we would have in addition to
burn coal enough to run some kind of an evaporator. What
kind it might be, to give us safe water and still consume the
least possible quantity of “black diamonds,” the captain left
to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>The problem started not with “How much water do we
need?” but with “How little water can we get by on?” I
canvassed this question with the doctor, the captain, the exec,
Ah Sam and finally Jack Cole—all of whom had something
to contribute on what was the least possible quantity needed
for drinking, for cooking, for tea, and for washing—and I
came out with the answer that 40 gallons of water a day,
about a gallon and a quarter for each one of our thirty-three
men, was the irreducible minimum.</p>

<p>Naturally for this quantity, which was more or less in line
with the daily capacity of any really ambitious Kentucky
moonshiner’s still, it was foolishness to think of firing up so
large a kettle as one of our main boilers. Thinking over what
else we had, my recollection lighted on a small Baxter boiler
which we had brought along to furnish steam for driving an
Edison electro-magnetic generator and illuminating the ship
with his newfangled carbon lamps. Edison’s generator having
proved a flat failure (probably because it got soaked in
salt water on our stormy crossing of Behring Sea) the captain
had ordered the whole works dismantled and struck below
into the hold. Without further delay, I had Lee and Bartlett
resurrect the Baxter boiler (leaving the rest of the outfit
below) and this little boiler with the help of my machinist
and fireman, I soon had rigged up inside the deckhouse,
with its steam outlet hooked to a small coil set outside in the
open air on top of the deckhouse, where the cold air would
act as a very effective condenser on the vapor passing through
the worm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, not waiting for this contraption to get into
action, at the surgeon’s suggestion the skipper ordered Cole
to break out from the hold a couple of barrels of lime-juice,
which on December 2 for the first time on the cruise, he
started to issue. In our mess, a pitcher of this stuff was placed
on the table at dinner, where under the watchful eye of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
surgeon, each one of us, sweetening it to taste, had to drink
an ounce. For the crew, Alfred Sweetman, carpenter, was
given the responsibility of seeing that the men took theirs,
and as each watch laid below for dinner, under Sweetman’s
observation, each man was handed a tin cup with his ration
of lime-juice and an ounce of sugar to sweeten the unsavory
mess, and compelled to drink it before he could draw his
food ration. Months of storage in casks had not improved
its flavor any, so in spite of Ambler’s gaze and Sweetman’s
vigilance, had it not been for the sugar generously served
out to sweeten the dose, I have little doubt that, scurvy or no
scurvy, all sorts of ingenious dodges would shortly have been
developed to avoid swallowing that tart medicine.</p>

<p>When the last pipe joint was tightened up, Bartlett fired
the Baxter boiler and we commenced distilling. Our first few
days at it were to my surprise pretty much a failure, for the
distilled water which we collected up on deck in a barrel set
underneath the outlet of the condensing worm, while better
than the melted snow, still tested far too high in salt for safe
use, and our diarrhoea continued unabated. This puzzled me
(not to mention severely disappointing the captain) and it
took some hours of sleuthing about to discover the trouble.
I then found that we were feeding the boiler from a tank
atop the deckhouse. This tank was filled by the seaman on
watch who hauled water to the topside in a bucket from a
hole chopped in the floe alongside. Unless the man was careful
(and a sailor working outside in a temperature of 30°
below zero is interested only in speed and not in care) he
would slop the sea water over both coil and deckhouse, from
which places enough trickled down into the fresh water barrel
to ruin completely our day’s output. Having discovered
this, I promptly rigged a pan over the barrel to catch the
drip and looked hopefully for better water. But my hopes
were dashed once again when, watching Surgeon Ambler test<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
a sample from our next barrel of water (the result of a whole
day’s distilling), I saw to my disgust the sample turn as milky
as ever immediately he dropped a little silver nitrate into it.</p>

<p>By now, we had been suffering four days from diarrhoea
and the situation was serious. I dropped everything else to
devote my whole time to watching the operation of our
evaporator, endeavoring by an analysis of what I could see
done and what theoretically must be going on inside the
apparatus from firebox to receiving barrel, to locate the reason
or reasons why from our sea water feed, we failed to get
over and condense a pure steam, leaving all the salt behind
as a brine in the boiler. Thinking at first we might be boiling
off the water too fast, I had Bartlett damp his fire somewhat
to make less steam, but I soon found that that solved nothing.
For with too little steam going up through our condensing
coil in the frigid atmosphere outside, the condenser promptly
froze up and burst a pipe, putting a stop to distilling altogether
till Lee thawed out the coil and repaired the leak.</p>

<p>But hardly had we resumed operation again when what I
saw gave me the answer. Bartlett started up his little feed
pump, and began vigorously to pump cold water into the hot
boiler to bring up the level in the glass. Promptly, as shown
by the needle on the gauge, the pressure in the boiler
tumbled and the water in the sight glass started to bubble
vigorously. And that had been our difficulty. The sudden
injection of cold feed water evidently created a vacuum in
the steam space. Under the reduced pressure the hot water
in the boiler had boiled off so violently that it carried salt
spray up with the steam and over into the distiller, where
it ruined our make.</p>

<p>Now I had it.</p>

<p>“Enough, brother!” I sang out to Bartlett. “Stop that
pump, haul fires and secure everything!”</p>

<p>And from then on, alternating between sweating over that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
hot boiler and freezing on our enforced trips to the “head,”
Bartlett, Lee, and I struggled all through the night. We
shifted the location of the feed water line inside the little
boiler to a point as far away from the steam space as we could
get it, and inserted a constriction in the steam line to the
feed pump so that no one could, even by accident, start the
pump suddenly or make it stroke at anything more than
dead slow speed.</p>

<p>In the early morning, we finished, refilled the boiler, fired
up, and again started distilling. When we had to feed the
boiler, we fed slowly (which was the only way the pump
would now run), and I felt sure from the slight fluctuation
of the pressure gauge that I had at last ensured operation
steady enough to eliminate priming. And when at noon with
the barrel half full of distilled water, Bartlett, Lee, and I,
in the front row of a cluster of fellow sufferers, gathered
wearily round the surgeon as he poised his silver nitrate solution
over the test cup, I felt there was some warrant for the
hearty cheer which echoed down the deck when Ambler
announced,</p>

<p>“Very pure, chief!”</p>

<p>So ended our struggle to get fresh water. And in a few
days our intestinal troubles ended too, a result for which all
hands were devoutly thankful. But when I reported our success
to the captain, while he was even more laudatory in
congratulating me than anyone else had been, still for him
there was a fly in the ointment which completely took the
edge off his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“How much coal does that distiller use up, Melville?” he
queried.</p>

<p>“About two pounds of coal per gallon of water made, sir,”
I answered.</p>

<p>He figured mentally a moment, blinked sadly at me
through his glasses, then muttered,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“Two pounds per gallon, chief? Why, it’s nearly a hundred
pounds of coal a day just for distilling! That expenditure
will ruin us if we have to keep it up. Snow, snow! That’s
what we need!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Continuing his program for dodging scurvy, De Long followed
up his exercise order by another calling for a thorough
monthly medical examination of all hands. In this I believe
he had two objects—the main one, of course, to give the
surgeon a chance to catch and deal with the first symptom
of disease and especially scurvy, before it had any opportunity
to get out of bounds; the other, by maintaining a record
at frequent intervals of our physical condition, to study the
effect of the long Arctic night and of Arctic conditions
generally on the human body, and to learn perhaps the best
method of combating these effects.</p>

<p>I read the order absent-mindedly, made a mental note that
at ten next morning I was due for examination, and in the
midst of my engrossment over the urgent problem of how
to save some coal, promptly put the matter out of my
thoughts. An hour later, Charley Tong Sing touched my
shoulder and announced in a singsong voice,</p>

<p>“Captain wantee you, chief, in cabin allee samee light
away.”</p>

<p>More discussions about coal economy, I presumed.</p>

<p>But that idea was quickly knocked out of my head when
stepping into the cabin I found myself facing not the captain
alone but also Mr. Collins.</p>

<p>A little surprised at this unexpected situation, I looked
enquiringly from one to the other. Both men were on their
feet, both were angry, and evidently trouble was in the offing.
Not being invited to take a seat, naturally I remained standing
also, looking quizzically from Collins to the captain, wondering
what was up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>I found out soon enough. De Long, waiting only till he
was sure that the steward was out of the room and the door
firmly closed behind me, with an evident effort to maintain
an even tone broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Melville, I’ve sent for you as the officer aboard with longest
experience in Service customs to get from you an independent
opinion on the propriety of my medical examination
order before I proceed to enforce it. It seems that Mr. Collins
here objects.”</p>

<p>So that was it.</p>

<p>I swore inwardly. Here was Collins heading for trouble
again, and unfortunately for me, here I was dragged into the
muddle, evidently by the captain this time, and from the
nature of the case, bound to offend our meteorologist if I
even opened my mouth. What ailed Collins anyway? I had
never seen a man on shipboard with such an unholy penchant
for getting himself into difficulties.</p>

<p>Apparently the wrinkling of my bald brow and the way
I fingered my beard as the situation hit me, gave Collins an
inkling of my feelings, for without giving me a chance to
speak, he burst out heatedly,</p>

<p>“You’re absolutely correct, I do object! And regardless of
what Melville or anybody else you bring in here may say,
I’m going to keep on objecting! I never liked that exercise
order you’ve already issued, even though I’m obeying it.
I’m a grown man, and I was before ever I saw this ship, and
I’ve got sense enough to decide for myself how much exercise
I need to keep my health and when I need to take it,
without anybody telling me. I don’t need to be ordered out
like a schoolboy for supervised play, nor have my steps
dogged like a poor man’s cur to see I take it. Nevertheless, I
swallowed that. But this is too much! I’ve got some rights
and I’ve got some pride! Even if I am down on the shipping
articles as a seaman, I’m not a damned guinea pig, to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
stripped naked every few weeks for the doctor to experiment
on!”</p>

<p>This time I guess my jaw did drop in open-mouthed astonishment.
That <em>seaman</em> business again. How it must be rankling
in Collins’ soul! I looked from Collins’ overwrought
face to De Long’s, flushing a fiery red. Had he been any
other skipper I had ever sailed with, I should have seen Collins
immediately clapped into the brig for gross insubordination.
But of the scholarly De Long’s reactions I was not so
certain. Prudently I closed my mouth without uttering a
word. There was nothing I could say anyway that wouldn’t
make a bad situation worse.</p>

<p>De Long’s blue eyes, a startling contrast to his burning
cheeks, blinked queerly through his glasses as he stood there,
struggling inwardly to control himself the while regarding
Collins.</p>

<p>“The scholar in him’s going to win out over the sailor,”
I thought to myself. “There’ll be no arrest.”</p>

<p>And so it proved. For what seemed an oppressive length
of time under that strain, the captain, without speaking,
glared at Collins and Collins unflinchingly glared back.
Finally in an unbelievably mild tone, the captain broke the
tension.</p>

<p>“Will you please be seated, chief? I should have asked you
before.” I sat down. “And that will do for you, Mr. Collins;
you may go now. I see that Mr. Melville and I will get along
much more rapidly discussing this subject without your
presence.”</p>

<p>Like an animal suddenly uncaged Collins, still glaring,
turned his back on us, and broke from the cabin, leaving
the door wide open. The captain closed it, then sank into
an armchair facing me, nervously chewing the twisted ends
of his mustaches. Still breathing heavily from his repressed
emotions, he turned to me,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“Melville, it seems that everything I do for the discipline
and safety of my crew, that man takes as a personal affront!
And now over this examination matter, he’s positively insubordinate!
I sent for you that we might all discuss that
order in a reasonable manner, and find out what’s wrong
with it, if anything is. But you saw what happened instead!
Nevertheless, chief, I want your frank opinion. Is there anything
wrong with that order?” De Long paused, looked
anxiously at me.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, captain,” I said, “I read it only
once hurriedly and then never gave it a second thought. The
Navy Regulations require us all to stand an annual physical
examination; what difference it makes to anyone, except to
the doctor who has to do the work, if it’s monthly, I can’t
see. But so long as Dr. Ambler isn’t complaining, what’s Collins
blowing up about it for?”</p>

<p>De Long shook his head wearily.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, unless he can’t get it out of his head that
I’m persecuting him. That hallucination of his about being
a seaman started him off on it long ago. Congress wrote the
law commissioning the <em>Jeannette</em> under which he shipped—I
didn’t. He had to ship that way or not at all, but Heaven
knows I’ve treated him as an officer in spite of it! A lot of
good it’s done. I try to make every allowance for his point
of view, but there is a limit. I can’t let him defy me on this
medical examination. Even if I were so derelict in my duty
as to allow discipline to be flouted by such mutinous conduct,
I just can’t take chances on having a sick crew in our desperate
situation!”</p>

<p>“Right enough, captain,” I agreed. “I should think even
Collins would see that. He’s an intelligent, educated man. But
I think there’s something in addition to the persecution bug
that’s biting him this time. Did you catch the inflection he
put on that word ‘naked’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid I was so astounded at his words, I missed his
inflections,” confessed the skipper. “What about it? What’s
wrong with ‘naked’ here, inflected or not? There’s not a
woman within a thousand miles of us to embarrass anybody.”</p>

<p>In spite of the gravity of the situation, I grinned inwardly
at that.</p>

<p>“Well, captain,” I said, “so much the worse for us. I just
have an idea that’s one reason this crew’s all so glum. But
that’s not what I was aiming at in Collins’ case. Women
don’t enter into his ideas of embarrassment. It’s all in the
way he was brought up. He’s a sensitive person, almost
morbid, I’d say, and the idea of having to strip before anybody,
especially under what he thinks is compulsion, gripes
his ideas of dignity and personal privacy. Now, I’m not excusing
insubordination, sir, but with Collins’ peculiar civilian
background in this expedition, since you’ve asked for it, I’d
suggest a modification of that order that’ll still get the results
and not hurt anybody’s feelings. Of course the change can’t
be for him alone; that would never do—but why not modify
it so’s the doctor examines all the officers stripped to the waist
only, and all the crew stripped completely? That’ll have two
good effects. It won’t require anything of Collins that offends
his dignity, and it’ll show him that he’s getting better treatment
than the ‘seamen’ he’s so wrought up about being classed
with. Then if anything’s ever going to clear the cobwebs out
of his brain and stop his bellyaching, that’ll do it.”</p>

<p>To De Long, already overburdened with a sense of failure
and the weight of the Arctic problems menacing us, and sincerely
desirous of maintaining harmony amongst his personnel,
this appealed as a sensible solution. He nodded
approvingly.</p>

<p>“A good idea,” he agreed, expansively relaxing in his chair.
“I’ll do it! And much obliged to you for the suggestion,
chief. It helps a lot to feel I can always rely on you to lend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
a hand when there’s anything wrong, whether with the machinery
or the men.”</p>

<p>“Hey, brother!” I cautioned, “easy on taking in so much
longitude in your thanks. Better wait till you see how it
works. I’ll guarantee the machinery on this ship, but God
himself won’t guarantee the men!” and with that I took my
departure and returned to my evaporator, leaving the captain
to redraft his order for the medical examinations.</p>

<p>To a degree, it worked. Collins, who it seems had submitted
a written protest in addition to expressing himself so
freely orally, when he read the revised order asked leave
to withdraw his objection, and submitted himself (though
very sullenly) to the examination which Dr. Ambler carried
out in the privacy of his cabin. And the captain, who, boiling
under Collins’ insolence, had been ready to hang him for
it, calmed down despite the fact that in a measure Collins
had won, and accepted the situation, treating Collins as courteously
as if nothing had ever arisen.</p>

<p>Collins, however, not appreciating his luck, failed to reciprocate.
Ever since the bear hunt incident, he had refused
to ask the captain’s permission to go on the ice, staying
aboard except when his routine observatory duties (and now
the enforced exercise order) gave him the opportunity to
leave the ship without asking. Instead, he had ostentatiously
paced the deck, indulging in what he was pleased to inform
us was “a silent protest,” which obviously gave him great
satisfaction, though why I don’t know for De Long diplomatically
took the sting out of that performance by totally
ignoring it. Now Collins withdrew still further into his shell,
avoiding the captain altogether except when duty made it
impossible, and what was worse for him, taking to avoiding
the rest of us also when he conveniently could, a proceeding
which hardly added to the sociability of the wardroom mess.
He even refused to say “Good morning” to any of us when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
first we greeted him in the messroom, and this boorishness
soon put him completely beyond the pale of our little society.</p>

<p>Queerly enough, Collins now began associating almost exclusively
with the very seamen with whom he took such
violent objection to being classed, spending most of his time
with my fireman Bartlett, and retailing to him and thus to
the crew generally, practically every bit of wardroom gossip
that he heard. Such a situation was hardly desirable aboard
ship, and De Long endeavored to put an end to it by privately
conveying to our meteorologist the information that
such association was decidedly contrary to naval custom and
that it was beneath his dignity as an officer so to consort with
enlisted men. But the captain’s friendly admonition only drew
more black looks from Collins, leaving De Long more perplexed
than ever over Collins who refused to comport himself
either as officer or seaman, and leaving Collins with his
persecution mania flaring up even more fiercely.</p>

<p>December dragged along. The ice around us kept freezing
thicker and thicker under the intense cold. On the surface,
the pack held together, but despite that, kept us uneasy.
Night and day (by the clock, that is, for so far as light went,
it was always night for us except for a semi-twilight around
noon) even in calm weather we were likely to be disturbed
by noises like the beating of the paddle wheels of innumerable
steamers and by occasional terrifying shocks on our hull,
all of which kept us jumpy. At first we had no explanation
for this uncanny state of affairs, the pack around us showing
no movement and the ship being solidly enough frozen in.</p>

<p>But Dunbar finally solved it for us. As he pointed it out,
evidently we were now suffering from a bombardment of
underrunning floes. Considerable masses of ice thrust under
the pack in the November breakups were kept constantly in
motion by the current beneath the refrozen surface. They
bumped along as best they could under its ragged contour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
giving that paddle wheel effect, and naturally enough when
one collided with our submerged hull, giving us the unpleasant
sensation of having struck a rock.</p>

<p>An understanding of the situation, while removing the
mystery, did not greatly help our peace of mind. None too
sure in the light of our past experiences, of the solidity of
the newly frozen pack, we were forever standing by for
an emergency with sledges, boats, knapsacks, and provisions
ready to go over the side. The monotony of continually expecting
trouble with none of the excitement of actually seeing
things happening, had its own peculiar effect on us, making
sound sleep impossible, killing our appetites, and leaving us
restless, listless, and haggard, a condition which the severe
physical discomforts of our situation naturally aggravated.</p>

<p>Still, for all our nervousness, we began to note some
strange things, the results of the intense cold which descended
on us. The atmosphere, practically free of moisture,
was startlingly clear, and never have I seen such brilliant
stars as shined down on us from those December Arctic
skies. Then (owing perhaps to the increased density of the
cold air) sounds on the ice traveled unusual distances and
boomed and reverberated as if from an overhead dome or
the roof of a mammoth cave. And the auroras, shimmering
across the sky in a dance of vivid colors, were indescribably
beautiful. But what struck us most, around thirty degrees
below zero, was the almost unbelievable effect of the cold
on the ice itself. Subjected to a temperature far below its
freezing point, the ice assumed a flinty hardness and strength
entirely different from its normal state. The floes grating
against each other, instead of crumbling under pressure, gave
out an unearthly high-pitched screech. And when we went
out with picks or axes to dig away the ice in the fire hole
under our stern, granite itself could not have been more
effective than that cold ice in turning the edges and blunting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the points of our tools.</p>

<p>Finally there was another effect of the extremely low temperature
which most of all racked our nerves. Standing, sitting,
or sleeping, who can accustom himself to having pistols
unexpectedly discharged practically in his ears? Yet we were
constantly exposed to such nervous shocks. For all over the
ship, the iron fastenings of our planking and our timbers,
contracting abnormally from temperatures never expected
by the builders, compressed the wood under the bolt heads
as the iron shrank till the wood, finally able to stand no more,
suddenly snapped with a noise like a pistol shot. And so startling
was each such explosion in one’s ears, so like a pistol
discharge, that even the thousandth time it happened, involuntarily
I jumped as badly as the first time I ever heard it.</p>

<p>Even the poor dogs suffered unexpected trials and I well
believe that to their canine souls, their difficulties were quite
as trying as ours. Like Dunbar, I had little natural sympathy
with the vicious brutes and saw little value in their presence,
but having been to some degree a party to transporting them
from their usual habitat, I could not but feel some responsibility
for their new troubles. And queerly enough it fell to
my lot as engineer partly to relieve them.</p>

<p>Aneguin and Alexey, our two Indians, were primarily
responsible for our forty dogs. Each day in the forenoon
watch, they fed them, bringing up from the forehold from
the cargo of dried fish we had taken aboard at Unalaska, the
necessary amount for issue, one dried fish per dog per day
being the authorized ration. Ordinarily, the wise dogs immediately
crushed their fish in their powerful jaws and swallowed
them in one gulp; the otherwise dogs (a pun I fear
almost worthy of Collins) found themselves fighting for the
remains of their fish with their mates who were quicker on
the swallow, a habit which always made feeding time alongside
ship a bedlam. Without particularly paying any attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
as to why, I noted vaguely that as December drew on,
this daily snarling of the dogs over their food subsided. As
a minor blessing I was duly grateful, until one day coming
aboard a little late after my prescribed exercise period, I saw
Alexey on the quarterdeck performing an autopsy on a dog
which following a brief illness the afternoon before had died
during the night. As I approached, Alexey removed from
the dog’s stomach a wad of oakum as big as a baseball, the
very evident cause of his death. I squeezed the ball, incredulous.
Oakum, all right. But why should even an Eskimo dog
eat that? I asked Alexey. Between pantomime and Indian
English he explained it to me,</p>

<p>“Fish in hold freeze, chief. Verr hard. Dog chew. Verr
hard. Lak iron. No good chew.” He seized a marlinspike,
went through the motions of a dog trying to chew a fish
frozen presumably as hard as iron, and very plainly breaking
his teeth on it. He laid down the marlinspike. “No good.
No chew fish, no swallow. Dog get ongry. Bym bye eat
oakum. Bym bye die.” Sadly he waved at the deceased dog.</p>

<p>That explained the cessation of our daily dog fights at
feeding time. The fish stowed in our hold had frozen so
hard there that no dog, no matter how energetically he
chewed, was now able to masticate his own fish quickly and
get it down. As a consequence, all the dogs being in the same
boat, too busily engaged trying to chew their own dinners
to bother about stealing each other’s, there were no fights.
But this poor devil, his teeth apparently unable to make any
impression on the fish, had been driven in desperation to
something softer and had unwittingly committed suicide by
gobbling the oakum.</p>

<p>I grunted sympathetically. A dog’s life, all right. But I
could fix it. Motioning Alexey to follow me inside the deckhouse,
I had him bring up from the hold one day’s issue of
fish, only thirty-nine now. They were frozen hard, no question;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
even with a crowbar, it would take a strong man to
make a visible impression on one of those glaciated fish.
Sizing up their approximate volume, I had Lee make a sheet
iron box large enough to hold the lot, and fit inside it a few
turns of pipe which I connected to the blowdown from our
evaporator, the Baxter boiler. Alexey tossed in the frozen fish,
and Lee put on the cover.</p>

<p>“That’ll thaw ’em out, Alexey,” I informed him. “Every
time we blow down the hot brine from that boiler, it’ll heat
the fish, and in a few hours, they’ll be so soft, even a dog
with false teeth won’t have any trouble with ’em. Now don’t
forget; fill the box every night, and by morning dinner for
the dogs will be all ready.”</p>

<p>Alexey, a very good Indian and deeply concerned for the
well-being of his charges, thanked me profusely, and judging
by the resumption of the snarling over dinner next day, I
guessed the dogs had reason to also.</p>

<p>But the dogs had still one more cross to bear that I could
not ease. Their instinctive habit in cold weather was to bed
themselves down at night in soft snow, keeping themselves as
comfortable that way as an Eskimo inside his igloo of ice.
But if we had reason to regret the absence of snow because
it deprived us of a source of fresh water, the dogs lamented
its absence even more because it robbed them of their natural
beds. Night after night they wandered round the ship disconsolately
looking for drifts, and finding none, were forced
at last to turn in on the bare ice. For some time, we had
noticed each morning here and there hair imbedded in the
ice, but when the December cold snap hit us, we were surprised
to find several dogs with so much hair frozen to the
ice that they just could not tear themselves free. There was,
however, nothing we could do about that except to make
it Aneguin’s regular detail to go out before feeding time each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
morning with a shovel and break out from the floe all the
dogs that had been frozen down the night before, a job which
required great finesse with the shovel on Aneguin’s part lest
all our dogs soon become as bald as Mexican hairless poodles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Monotonously the dreary days drifted by. In darkness we
ate our food, took our exercise, thawed out our frozen noses
afterward, and vaguely wished we could “go somewheres.”
December 22, the shortest day of the year came, bringing
with it, aside from the most brilliant display of auroras we
had yet witnessed, only the knowledge that with the sun at
its extreme southern declination, half of our seventy-one day
long night was gone. But the day itself was further marked
by the fact that Mr. Dunbar, that veteran whaler and the
only member of our mess who had ever before wintered
inside either the Arctic or the Antarctic Circles, came down
with a bad cold. His tough hide had according to his own
claim always before resisted illness, so this made him doubly
miserable, and he moped around the wardroom very low in
spirit. Finally, as if to make sure that we remembered the
day, Danenhower also complained that his left eye pained
him, and after a session with the doctor, big Dan completed
our picture of wardroom woe by coming in with a black
patch over the ailing optic, explaining that Ambler had found
it somewhat inflamed and had advised him to give it a rest
by shielding it even from the poor glow of our oil lamps for
several days.</p>

<p>Two days later we came to Christmas Eve, which for us,
except for plenty of ice around, was everything that traditionally
Christmas Eve is not. No children about, eagerly excited
over hanging up their stockings; no friends dropping in;
no families, no wives, no sweethearts—nothing of these for
any of us, but instead only the memories of bygone Christmases
under happier circumstances, and the hope (clouded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
gnawing doubts) that another Christmas might see us out
of the ice and restored home.</p>

<p>We gathered in the wardroom, a glum group—Dunbar
nursing his cold, Danenhower with his black patch looking
like a pirate in distress, Ambler, De Long, Chipp, Newcomb,
and myself. Only Collins was missing. That his presence
would have added any gaiety was questionable, but that he
saw fit to stay locked in his stateroom keeping the wardroom
bulkhead between himself and us, certainly added to the general
gloom. And gloomy it certainly was in that room—a
smoky oil lamp the only illumination, the warped wood
panels of the bulkheads the only decoration, overhead the
deck beams heavily covered with insulating layers of felt and
canvas, dismally sagging under the weight of the combination
of frost and moisture with which they were saturated, and
beneath our feet the sloping wood deck, wet from the condensate
dripping off the cold forward bulkhead.</p>

<p>I did the best I could to lighten matters up. Back at the
Mare Island Navy Yard before we left, Paymaster Cochran
had thoughtfully presented me with a bottle of fine old Irish
whiskey which I had so far carefully hoarded. Now I broke
it out from beneath my berth, scraped together some other
ingredients, and with all hands watching, mixed a punch in
the soup tureen. In the damp chill of the barren wardroom,
we filled our glasses, lifted them.</p>

<p>“To Cochran!” I proposed. “May he yet be Paymaster
General!”</p>

<p>With no disagreement to this, we all downed Cochran’s
whiskey, and warmed a little by the fiery Irish spirits,
promptly refilled our glasses. There was just enough for a
second round. I looked questioningly at De Long for him
to propose the second and (of necessity) last toast. Whom
would he choose, James Gordon Bennett, the sponsor of our
venture; the President; someone more personal, perhaps?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>But Danenhower gave him no chance. Lifting his glass, he
waved it over the empty bowl, swept us all with his one uncovered
eye, and sang out,</p>

<p>“To our old shipmates, Emma De Long and Sylvie—may
they never have cause to worry over us!”</p>

<p>That also I could heartily endorse, so wasting no regrets
over the amenities due Bennett or the President, I raised my
glass to drink as did the others, when Dunbar alongside me
poked me in the ribs. I leaned over toward him.</p>

<p>“Mrs. De Long’s all right with me,” he whispered, his
voice hoarse from his cold, “but who’s this Sylvie?”</p>

<p>“Captain De Long’s daughter,” I hissed. “You old fool!
Drink it down before he knocks you down!”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” mumbled Dunbar. “I thought maybe she
might be Newcomb’s sweetheart.” He drank his whiskey at
a gulp.</p>

<p>And that just about ended our party. With no more punch
to serve as an excuse for conviviality, the conversation soon
faded into the general murk gripping the room, and with
everyone seemingly immersed in memories of happier Christmas
Eves, one by one all hands drifted away to warm over
their recollections in the solitude of their staterooms.</p>

<p>Christmas Day, mainly because it lasted longer, was even
more dreary than Christmas Eve. A high wind and biting
clouds of fine snow made going on deck or on the ice wholly
uninviting. Confined again to the wardroom or to our staterooms,
we moped over our memories, tried to imagine how
friends, relatives, or families were spending the day, and
thought a little enviously of Navy shipmates in port the
world over with vessels decorated from deck to trucks with
wreaths and garlands of greenery, and wardrooms echoing
with the alluring laughter of women troubled with no deeper
problem than how after dinner to get a husband or a sweetheart
excused from watch and off the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>We did have a grand dinner, to provide which Ah Sam
performed miracles with the humdrum materials available
in the storeroom, topping off all with mince pies soaked in
brandy. The eating of this unexpected banquet almost made
us forget our surroundings and our situation. But not quite,
for we ate our dinner to the constant rumbling of the unseen
pack, the occasional explosive snapping of timber fastenings,
and even a few sharp shocks from underrunning floes. And
like a death’s head at the feast, to show that all was not joy
and brotherly love on the <em>Jeannette</em> on this Christmas Day,
there next to Danenhower at the foot of the table was Collins’
chair—empty, while Collins, sulking in his stateroom,
dined alone.</p>

<p>I think I misstate nothing when I say that in the wardroom
of the <em>Jeannette</em> we were all thoroughly grateful to see the
last of that Christmas Day, and I have little doubt that each
of us fervently prayed ever to be spared another like it.</p>

<p>December dragged away. We came to the end of the year
1879. To help the crew in welcoming in the year 1880 on
which now he banked heavily for success, the captain sent
forward four quarts of brandy, while I did what I could with
a fifth quart to provide good cheer for the wardroom mess.
As a result, when the rapid ringing of the ship’s bell at midnight
marked the birth of 1880, the whole crew (despite a
temperature nearly 40° below zero) gathered on the quarterdeck
just outside De Long’s cabin, gave three cheers for the
<em>Jeannette</em>, sent an embassy of two into the wardroom to wish
us all a Happy New Year, and then hastily beat a retreat to
the berth deck to warm up on those four bottles.</p>

<p>This evidently so heartened the crew that after their New
Year’s dinner (mince pie and brandy once more) they staged
an entertainment, the high lights of which were Aneguin imitating
Ah Sam singing over his kettles, and a prompt and
contemptuous imitation by Ah Sam of an Indian attempting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
to imitate a Chinaman, which performance brought down
the house.</p>

<p>This comic relief for a brief while took our thoughts off
what our more sober senses looked forward to with misgivings
in contemplating 1880. Under our noses, so to speak,
as we emerged from the crew’s entertainment to the deck,
was the unpleasant discovery that the mercury in our thermometers
had frozen at -40° F., unobtrusively suggesting
thereby that what we had so far seen of Arctic temperatures
was merely an introduction to what was yet to come.</p>

<p>A second more disquieting situation was that Danenhower’s
eye inflammation had grown worse. The doctor had that day
been forced to put him on the sicklist, confining him to his
room in absolute darkness because the slightest light falling
on his eye caused severe pain. Aside from the fact that the
loss of his services threw an added load on the remaining
officers—the captain, Chipp, and myself—in carrying on the
ship’s work, his condition gave us real cause for worry. In
case the ship went out from under us, leaving us stranded
on the ice, there was a blinded and a helpless officer on our
hands to care for, probably requiring to be dragged every
inch on a sled, for it was as much as even a man with two
perfectly good eyes could do to get over that rough pack
without breaking his neck every few steps.</p>

<p>What had caused Danenhower’s eye troubles? All of us,
from the first day we were caught in the pack until the sun
in November vanished for good, had religiously worn snow
goggles, for the glare off the ice was intolerable to face. Why
had Danenhower, the youngest regular officer we had and
physically by far the most powerful member of the wardroom
mess, been knocked out by eye failure when neither
forward nor aft had anybody else in the ship’s company been
so much affected? Puzzling over that, I could conclude only
that it was an unfortunate combination of his job and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
personal characteristics functioning under very unfavorable
circumstances. Dan was navigator. Innumerable times he stood
under terrible conditions of cold, straining his eyes through
his sextant, trying to get with poor horizons (or with an
artificial mercury horizon) shots at the sun, the moon, or
the stars to establish our position as we drifted with the pack.
That was bad enough, but what apparently was worse was
that Dan was the most painstaking and the most indefatigable
worker over account books I ever saw aboard ship. In addition
to being navigator, he was our supply officer, and hour
after hour he had pored over coal reports and storeroom
records, figuring and refiguring, trying to keep track of and
account for each pound of coal used, almost each ounce of
flour expended. Under the poor lamplight by which since
early November he had worked continuously, the load on
his eyes, already overstrained by constant squinting through
sextant telescopes, proved too much and an inflammation
enveloped his left eye, shortly developing into an abscess
which threatened to blind that eye completely and even involve
the other one. The result was that in a desperate effort
to save his sight, the doctor was forced to make Dan a prisoner,
forbidden (except when completely blindfolded, he was
led out for meals) to leave the darkness of his room. And
few prisoners in history, regardless of the horrors of their
medieval dungeons, ever had a worse outlook to face than
Danenhower in his pitch-black cell—small, damp, chilly, and
with always the rumbling and screeching of the pack to
remind him that any day the unseen walls of his prison
might collapse and the prison itself sink from under him,
leaving him helpless on the ice.</p>

<p>Over all of us, his shipmates, Danenhower’s disaster threw
a pall of gloom that New Year’s Day. Over De Long, who
felt a special responsibility for each man in the ship’s company,
it fell like a blight, evoking apparitions for 1880 of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
calamities yet undreamed of.</p>

<p>So ended our holiday season—a dismal Christmas and a
worse New Year’s, leaving us with the temperature starting
downward from -40° F. to face whatever new the pack had
to offer.</p>

<p>January drew along, bringing gales, biting clouds of flying
ice particles, and deeper cold. The ice, getting denser and
denser as it grew colder, shrank, and about the middle of
the month cracked open, forming little canals on both sides,
leaving us in a small island of ice hardly a shiplength across.
We contemplated that dubiously, for if any pressure came
from the pack about us, now forty inches thick, we would
receive almost directly the thrust of the pressing floes with
no protection at all. But luckily no pressure came before the
extraordinary cold rushed to our rescue by freezing the
water which welled up in the fissures. The first half of the
month, therefore, went by with only the usual monotonous
groaning and rumbling of the pack and occasional nips on
our hull to keep us in mind of our position.</p>

<p>January 19, 1880, was on the other hand a red letter day
for us. In the silence following the subsidence of a gale which
was in no way worse than many another we had experienced,
for no reason apparent to us the floe into which we were
frozen began early in the morning to crack and split in every
direction. Promptly the anchor watch sent word below, and
as usual, we all came tumbling up on deck, there to remain
stockstill in our tracks as awestruck we watched in the unearthly
half twilight of the Arctic a sight entirely new to us.</p>

<p>North, south, east, or west, it was the same. In a large
circle surrounding the ship, the surface of the pack was
everywhere heaving up into a ring of rugged mountains high
above the level of the sea! Huge masses of ice, large as ocean
liners, pitched and rolled on the crests, while reverberating
from all about came a shrieking and a screeching from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
tumbling ice that froze the very marrow in our bones. Like
the jaws of a slowly closing vise, that circle drew in on us—ahead,
astern, on either beam—whichever way we looked
there was an approaching mountain of ice steadily, relentlessly
advancing on the <em>Jeannette</em> across the small expanse of
yet unbroken pack, while on that undulating ring with cracks
streaking across it like forked lightning, the floes parted with
roars like thunder, forming a deep bass background for the
“high scream” of the flintlike ice of grating floebergs, the
whole echoing across the pack to us in a veritable devil’s
symphony of hideous sounds.</p>

<p>The ring was still a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p>On the bridge, Captain De Long, eyeing it, cupped his
hands to try to make himself heard above the din, bellowed
to those on the spar deck below,</p>

<p>“All hands! Stations for abandon ship!”</p>

<p>Listlessly we moved to our stations abreast the loaded
sledges on the poop, but what could we do? Enclosed on all
sides by that shrinking circle of tumbling ice, where could
we go for safety when we abandoned ship? Even unincumbered
by sledges or knapsacks there was not a chance in the
world of scaling the slopes of those moving mountains of
ice against the stream of floebergs cascading down their sides.
Flight was impossible, annihilation certain!</p>

<p>Dunbar was by my side. With a seagoing eye he scanned
the little plain of unbroken pack still surrounding us, then
muttered,</p>

<p>“That ice is approaching us at the rate of a fathom a minute.
It’s still sixty fathoms off. In sixty minutes, chief, we’ll all
pass over to the Great Beyond!”</p>

<p>Apparently he was right. Motionless, silent for the most
part, we stood, clinging to our useless sledgeloads of pemmican.
That terrifying ring, irresistible, inexorable, shrank in
on us. Numbly we waited for that avalanche of ice to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
tumbling aboard, crushing us like flies, crushing our ship.</p>

<p>On it came. Fifty fathoms, forty fathoms, thirty fathoms.
Then as inexplicably as the motion had started, it stopped,
a shiplength or so away, leaving us after an hour of looking
death squarely in the face, limp, completely drained of emotions,
and incredulous almost of being still alive. Slowly the
hills of ice flattened out, there remaining around us an indescribable
“Bad Lands” of broken floes; and the shrieking
died away into a strange quiet except for the rumble of
underrunning floes bumping along in the current beneath
our pack. It was over, we were safe, our vessel undamaged.
Yet had the ship been a few hundred feet in any direction
from the exact spot in which she lay, she would inevitably
have been lost, and we with her.</p>

<p>Feeling like men reprieved when the noose had been tightened
about our throats and the trap all but sprung, we left
the poop slowly, noticing for the first time how cold we
were. But in spite of that, curious to examine at still closer
range the danger we had so narrowly escaped, all hands except
those on watch clambered down the starboard gangway
to the ice and were soon dispersed among the nearest slopes,
climbing the pinnacles, gazing in awe at some of the nearer
floebergs standing upended from the pack, and speculating on
the results had this or that colossal berg capsized on our
vessel.</p>

<p>On the <em>Jeannette</em>, five bells struck. It was 10:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, the
time for serving out the daily allotment of coal for the galley,
the heating stoves fore and aft, and the distillers. Regretfully
I turned my back on the marvelous vista of ice peaks and
canyons stretching before me, and with a frozen nose, bleary
eyes, and a beard white with frost from my heavy breathing,
started stiffly back to the ship. I wanted to make sure that
young Sharvell, the most inexperienced of my four coalheavers,
whose turn it was to break out the coal from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
bunkers, was not imposed upon either by the guile of that
Chinaman, Ah Sam, or the bullying of the bosun into passing
out a pound more of our precious fuel than was allotted
them by my orders.</p>

<p>I climbed the gangway, crossed the deck to the machinery
hatch, and was halfway down the ice-covered iron ladder,
just turning on the middle grating to descend into the fireroom,
when in that darkness, as if the devil were after him,
a man came bounding up the ladder, rammed me in the
stomach, and nearly ricocheted me off the grating to the
fireroom floor below. I saved myself only by grabbing his
arm as he shot by. But to my surprise, instead of stopping,
he struggled to tear loose and continue on his way. In the
gloom, I peered at him. It was little Sharvell, my coalheaver,
apparently badly frightened, his rolling eyeballs and pallid
face startlingly white against the smudges of coal dust on his
forehead. Well, I was no doubt as white, having just had my
wind completely knocked out by his carelessness, and I was
mad besides. I tightened my grip on him.</p>

<p>“You clumsy cow,” I gasped, “wait a minute there! What
d’ye mean by—”</p>

<p>The next I knew, I was talking to myself. Sharvell, twisting
free, was racing up the ladder.</p>

<p>Thoroughly enraged now, I shouted after him,</p>

<p>“Damn you! Come back here!”</p>

<p>But Sharvell did not come back, he kept on climbing. The
thought, however, of coming back penetrated his fright
enough to loosen his tongue, for he yelled down to me,</p>

<p>“On deck, quick, chief, while you got a chance! The ship’s
sinking! The fireroom’s flooded already!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The <em>Jeannette</em> sinking? Sharvell must be crazy. The ship
had gone through far worse squeezes before without a leak.
Nevertheless, forgetting our encounter, I raced down the
ladder. There was the fireroom entirely flooded from port
to starboard, with water already over the floorplates and
rising steadily toward my empty boilers!</p>

<p>For a second I stared in cold dismay. No steam on the ship
to run a pump. If the water rose over our furnaces before
we got our fires going and steam up, there would never be
any steam—and we were through! Once the water got that
high, nothing under Heaven could prevent the ship from filling
at her leisure and sinking from under us. I had to get
steam and get it fast!</p>

<p>On deck, Sharvell had already spread the alarm. Even as I
watched the rising water, sizing up my procedure, estimating
my chances of getting steam before the water got us, overhead
I heard the noise of running feet, guns being fired to
recall the men on the ice, the shrill piping of the bosun, and
Jack Cole’s stentorian call,</p>

<p>“Man the pumps!”</p>

<p>Man the pumps? Why man them? There in the engine
room a little abaft me, their bases already in the water, were
my frost-covered pumps. What they imperatively needed in
those frozen cylinders was steam, not manning. Then it came
to me. The <em>Jeannette</em> was a sailing ship as well as a steamer—she
still carried hand pumps, the same crude hand pumps with
which Columbus had kept his leaky caravels afloat. And they
might save us too; keep the water down below the level of
my furnace grates till I raised steam!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>And now came action. Down the ladder to join me slid
my black gang—Lee, machinist; Bartlett, fireman; all my assortment
of coalheavers—Boyd; Lauterbach, the German;
Iversen, the Swede; and even that frightened little Englishman,
Sharvell. In the biting cold of the fireroom, 29° below
zero (it was 45° below outside), I hastily detailed them.</p>

<p>“Lee! Get aft into the engine room and line up the main
steam pump to suck on this fireroom as soon as you get
steam!”</p>

<p>“Bartlett! Outboard there with you! Open the port sea
cock and flood the port boiler to the steaming level. Open
her wide, and four bells on that flooding!”</p>

<p>“Lauterbach! Get some kindling wood down here from
the galley! Shake it up now, and mind you keep that kindling
dry! And while you’re on the topside, tell the skipper
I’m firing up the port boiler!”</p>

<p>“Iversen, you and Sharvell start breaking out the coal. Get
plenty, and keep it in the buckets, out of this water!”</p>

<p>“Boyd! Spread the fuel in both furnaces in the port boiler
as fast as it comes to you, and get an oil torch going, ready
to light off when the water’s up to level!”</p>

<p>In the faint gleam of a few oil lamps in that frigid fireroom,
off the men splashed through the ice water on the
floorplates, an incongruous group for a black gang if ever
there was one, as clad all in furs from hoods to boots they
stumbled away to their stations in a temperature more suitable
to the inside of a refrigerator than to a boiler room.</p>

<p>On deck, I heard the clatter of equipment and the banging
of mauls, Cole’s shouts, the hoarse responses of running
seamen, and the curses of Nindemann and Sweetman struggling
to break out crossbars and handles frozen to the bulkheads
and rig the hand gear for working the forward bilge
pump—a tough job in that sub-zero atmosphere on the topside
with everything iron shrunk by the cold, everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
wood swelled by frost and moisture, and nothing fitting together
properly as it should.</p>

<p>But long before they got the hand pump on deck assembled,
I ran into troubles of my own. Bartlett, wrestling with
the port sea cock (I had chosen that side because the ship
being heeled to starboard, it was the only one still showing
above water), his stocky frame and brawny shoulders straining
against the wrench, sang out to me,</p>

<p>“This cock’s frozen, chief! I can’t get her open!”</p>

<p>I jumped to his aid. Together we heaved on an extension
handle to the valve wrench. No movement. I was desperate.
We had to get that cock open to the sea or we could not
fill our boiler. More beef was needed on the wrench. I looked
inboard. There in the dull light of the oil torch in his hand,
before the port boiler waiting for fuel to arrive, was big
Boyd, doing nothing.</p>

<p>“Boyd! Lend a hand here!”</p>

<p>Boyd shoved his torch into the cold furnace, splashed
over to us. The three of us, fireman, coalheaver, engineer,
braced ourselves against a floor stringer, put our backs into
it, heaved with all our might against that wrench handle.
The cock gave way suddenly, twisted open. I sighed thankfully,
let go the wrench.</p>

<p>“Watch her now, Bartlett,” I cautioned. “Wide open to
the sea till the water shows halfway in the boiler sight glass,
then shut off! Careful now; it’ll only take a few minutes.
Don’t overfill her!”</p>

<p>But I might have spared both my thanks and my caution.
Bartlett waited a moment for the water to rush through
from the sea into the empty boiler, then feeling no vibration
in the pipe to indicate flow, stooped, pressed his ear near
(but not too near) the frost-coated sea cock, and listened
carefully. Not a murmur of running water. Bartlett lifted
his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“No water coming through, chief.”</p>

<p>No water? I felt sick. Then that long disused seachest
must be plugged with ice! Frozen solid where beyond the
valve it passed through our thick wood side to the sea, totally
beyond our reach for thawing out, effectively blocking
off any flow of water. We could not fill our boiler!</p>

<p>I cursed inwardly. Literally we were sunk now. Caught
with no steam, boilers empty, unable to get water into them
to raise steam, what good to us now was all the coal we had
saved for our exploring by that economy? There the saved
coal lay, worse than useless in the bunkers, serving only to
ballast down the ship that she might sink the faster under us!</p>

<p>Thump, thump! Thump, thump!</p>

<p>From on deck came a welcome sound. The carpenters had
at last got the handles rigged. The hand pump was starting!
With four men on each side swaying over the bars,
vigorously putting their backs into each stroke, that steady
thumping gave me new hope. If the hand pump, inefficient
though it was, could only keep the leak from gaining too fast
on us, I still had a chance! Water to fill the boiler? Why
bother about the sea? We were standing in an ocean of salt
water right there in our fireroom and more was coming in
all the time! All I needed was time enough to get a boiler
full of it off the submerged floorplates into that port kettle,
and I could light off!</p>

<p>“Bartlett, forget that sea cock! On top of that port boiler
with you and your wrench. Open up the manhole there,
then stand by the opening to receive water in buckets! Boyd,
get Sharvell and Iversen out of the bunkers, get some buckets,
and form a line to pass water up to Bartlett as soon as he
gets that manhole open!”</p>

<p>Bartlett scrambled over the furnace fronts and up on top
of the boiler. Boyd passed up his torch to illuminate the work,
and I tossed up a sledge hammer to help him start the bolts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
on the manhead. While Bartlett labored over the bolts and
Boyd and the other coalheavers scurried through the engine
room and the fireroom collecting all the buckets, I stood a
moment before the port boiler, sizing up the situation.</p>

<p>Where was all that water coming from anyway? There
was no sign of damage, no sign of leak in the machinery
spaces. From forward, probably; we had got some very bad
raps on the bow during the morning’s excitement. Perhaps
an underrunning floe had rammed our stern, opened up our
forepeak. If such were the case, that hand pump running on
deck forward was in the best location to hold down the water,
to keep it from rising too rapidly here amidships. I listened
an instant to the rapid <em>thump</em>, <em>thump</em> of the oscillating
handles, then caught mixed with the noise a husky cry from
the men at the pump,</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Spell O!</span>”</p>

<p>There was a break in the rhythmic thumping, a new gang
stepped in and relieved the men at the handles, then the
monotonous throbbing was resumed. <span class="smcap">Spell O</span>, the cry for
relief, already coming from the first gang manning the pumps!
Backbreaking work that, all right. How long could the sixteen
men we had on deck, even relieving each other frequently,
keep those handles flying up and down fast enough
to give us a chance in the fireroom? Not for long could
human muscles stand that pace, I feared. It would be nip and
tuck between us and the rising water.</p>

<p>From atop the boiler came the banging of metal on metal
and the muffled curses of Bartlett as sprawled out in the
scanty space between boiler and deck beams overhead, he
fought with sledge and wrench to loosen the manhole bolts.
Lauterbach came cautiously down the fireroom ladder, balancing
a huge armful of kindling. I motioned him to toss
it onto the grates, then to join Boyd, Iversen, and Sharvell
with the buckets. In silence, we waited below, listening to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
the mingled chorus of the banging sledge hammer, the rasping
screech of rusty nuts, and the fluent profanity of Bartlett,
prone on his stomach, a fantastic fur-clad demon with his
distorted face showing up intermittently in the flickering
flame of the torch, battling the boiler beneath him. No one
could help him; there wasn’t room for two men to work in
those confined quarters. And there was no use giving him
any advice either. So below we stood, straining our eyes impatiently
toward Bartlett, while inch by inch the water rose
on us and the margin between water level and furnace grates
shrank. The hand pumps on deck were losing out—they had
slowed up the rise, but they could not stop it.</p>

<p>My chilled legs felt cramped. Instinctively, not taking my
gaze off Bartlett, I tried to flex my knees to relieve them,
shifting my weight from one foot to the other. I found I
could not lift either leg. Looking down sharply, I saw for the
first time what before in the poor light had escaped my
notice—in that intense cold, far below zero, the water was
turning to slush, ice was forming here and there over its
surface, and both my feet were solidly frozen down to the
iron floorplates on which I stood!</p>

<p>I gripped my legs one at a time with both hands, savagely
tore them free.</p>

<p>“Keep moving, boys!” I warned the men in the water
alongside me. “If you stand still a minute, you’ll be frozen
down!” And standing there in that fast freezing water, at
29° below zero, I was at least thankful for the four pairs of
wool socks, the three suits of blue flannel underwear, and
the two pairs of woolen mittens which encased me under my
fur suit and boots, for otherwise by now, between cold water
and cold air, I should have been frozen stiff as a board.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>With a final blow of his sledge, Bartlett knocked free the
last dog, lifted out the boiler manhead, shouted,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“All clear, chief!”</p>

<p>“Start those buckets!” I ordered, but it was unnecessary.
Already Boyd had dipped the first one full, was passing it up
to Bartlett, who dashed the contents through the open manhole
into the boiler, where splashing over the frigid iron
plates inside, I haven’t the slightest doubt but that it promptly
became ice.</p>

<p>Round and round went the buckets, Lauterbach filling,
Boyd and Iversen passing them up full to Bartlett, and little
Sharvell catching the empties as they came tumbling down
the boiler front. All the men were soon coated from head
to foot with ice from the water slopping from the buckets—only
their constant stooping, rising, and twisting which kept
cracking the ice off in sheets prevented their soon accumulating
so heavy a weight of it as no man could even stagger
under.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as they labored, I turned to, and took Boyd’s
place in spreading fuel on the grates, preparatory to lighting
off. Hastily I scattered the kindling over the cold furnace
bars, then slid several buckets of coal out the nearest bunker
door, carefully maneuvering them through the slush and ice
across the flooded floorplates to avoid slopping the sea water
which reached nearly to the tops of the buckets, in on the
coal. Seizing then a shovel, I started to heave coal into the
furnaces, an awkward job, for getting the shovel into the tops
of the upright buckets was difficult, and naturally I dared
not dump the coal out on the floorplates first. As best I could,
I managed it, spreading the coal over the kindling, a little
thin at the front of the grates, a thicker bed at the rear.
That done, I leaned back on my shovel, and alternated between
watching the waterline creeping up the boiler fronts
and my men frantically passing up buckets to fill the boiler.</p>

<p>It was a big boiler, eight feet in diameter, and would require
innumerable buckets. Mentally I calculated it, making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
a rough estimate. Nine tons of water had to be manhandled
up into that boiler to fill it properly, a thousand bucketfuls
at the very least. I timed the heavy buckets; about six a
minute were going up, but the men could hardly maintain
that pace. Still, even if they could, it would take three hours
to fill that boiler to the steaming level! Long before then, the
fireboxes at the bottom of the boiler would be flooded, we
could never light off! Somehow, we had to keep the water
down in the fireroom till I got steam, or the <em>Jeannette</em> was
doomed. And her going meant a two hundred mile retreat
over the broken pack to Siberia—in mid January at 40° or
worse below zero, an absolutely hopeless journey!</p>

<p>“Keep ’em flying, boys!” I called out to my coalheavers,
“while I lay up on deck for help. I’ll be back here in a
minute!”</p>

<p>Coated with ice to the waist, I clambered up the ladder,
went forward into the deckhouse. Swinging on the pump bars
there, were eight straining seamen; against the bulkhead, resting
a moment, were eight more, including even the Chinamen
Ah Sam and Tong Sing. A little forward of them was De
Long, anxiously peering down a hatch into the forepeak,
while below him in that gloomy hole, Lieutenant Chipp and
Nindemann were sloshing round in deep water with a lantern,
searching for the source of our troubles.</p>

<p>“Where’s the leak, captain?” I asked, bending down alongside
him.</p>

<p>De Long straightened up, intensely worried.</p>

<p>“We don’t know, chief; Chipp can’t find it. All he can see
is that the water’s gushing through that supposedly solid pine
packing the Navy Yard filled our bow with, as if it were a
sieve. The leak’s in the stem, down somewhere near the keel;
I think our forefoot’s twisted off.” He looked at me with
haggard eyes. “We’re still holding our own on the forepeak
with the hand pump; but the men’ll break down before long.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
How soon can you give us steam and help out, chief?”</p>

<p>I drew him aside, a little away from that squad of resting
seamen, not wishing to discourage them.</p>

<p>“Never, captain!” I whispered hoarsely, “unless we get
help ourselves!” Briefly I outlined our desperate position.
There was no hand pump in the fireroom, the water was gaining
on us there also. “I’ve got to have a gang to hoist water
out of that fireroom by hand someway to keep it down till
my boiler’s filled and I get steam up, or we’re done for! And
it’ll take three hours yet. My gang’s all busy. Who can you
spare?”</p>

<p>De Long gazed at me somberly.</p>

<p>“Except Danenhower, who’s blind, every man and officer’s
working now. But Newcomb and Collins are only collecting
records in case we abandon ship. Will they do?”</p>

<p>I laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>“Newcomb isn’t worth a damn for real work, captain; and
from what I’ve heard from Collins, you could shoot him
before he’d turn to as a seaman! Besides, two are not enough
anyway. It’ll take six good men at least, to keep ahead of that
water, and then they may not do it. But give me Cole and
half of that relief gang at the pumps there and I’ll try.”</p>

<p>“That’ll reduce us here to six men a shift on the pump
handles,” muttered the captain, dubiously eyeing the crew
at the pump. “But we’ve got to get steam! All right, Melville,
take them. But for God’s sake, hurry it up!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” I turned abruptly to our Irish bosun, who
was nearby supervising the pumping. “Jack, pick four men
out of the gang here, any four, and come aft with me. Shake
a leg, now!” I started for the after door in the deckhouse.</p>

<p>Cole grabbed Starr, a Russian and physically the strongest
seaman in our crew, off the starboard pump handle; took
Manson, a burly Swede, off the port handle to even things
up, and beckoned to Ah Sam and Tong Sing from the relief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
gang.</p>

<p>“C’mon, me byes; lay aft wid yez!” Cole marshalled his little
detail out of the compartment and slammed the deckhouse
door behind them almost before the twelve startled men left
at the pump could realize that they now had the work of all
sixteen to carry on.</p>

<p>Close outside the deckhouse stood the barrel which received
the fresh water condensed in our distiller. That barrel was
just what I needed; distilling for the present was the least
of my worries.</p>

<p>“Jack,” I explained briefly, “the fireroom’s flooding on us.
We got to keep that water down till I get fires started. Sling
that barrel in a bridle, rig it on a whip to the davit over the
machinery hatch, and start hoisting water out of the fireroom,
four bells and a jingle! She’s all yours now, Jack! Get
going!”</p>

<p>Cole, a rattling good bosun if I ever saw one, needed nothing
further.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sor. Lave ut to Jack!” In a moment he had
that Russian, the Swede, and the two Chinamen round the
barrel, emptying it; in another second they were rolling it
aft; and as I started down the ladder to the fireroom, Cole
had the barrel on end again and already was expertly throwing
a couple of half hitches in a manila line round it to serve
as a sling.</p>

<p>Almost before I got down the ladder to my fireroom again,
the barrel came tumbling down the hatch at the end of a
fall and landed alongside me with a splash, while above, Cole
roared out,</p>

<p>“Below there! She’s all yours! Fill ’er up!”</p>

<p>Being nearest, I tipped the barrel sidewise in the water,
pushed it down till it submerged, then righted it. It filled with
a gurgle, settled through the slush to the floor plates.</p>

<p>“Full up!” I shouted. “Take it away!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, aye!” The line to the barrel tautened, then started
slowly to rise. Down the hatch floated Cole’s voice, encouraging
his squad on the hoisting line,</p>

<p>“Lay back wid yez, Rooshian! Heave on it, ye Swede! An’
git those pigtails flyin’ in the breeze, ye two Chinks, or we’ll
all be knockin’ soon at the Pearly Gates, an’ fer sailor min
the likes of us, wid damned little chanct to get past St. Peter!
Lively wid yez; all togither now. Heave!”</p>

<p>The loaded barrel suddenly shot up the hatch.</p>

<p>Hurriedly Cole swung it over to the low side scuppers,
dumped it, and sent it clattering down again. Once more I
filled it, started it up, then called Lee, my machinist, from
the engine room pump to stand by on that filling job while
I went back to the all-important boiler.</p>

<p>Why go into the agony of the next two hours? Wearily,
without relief, my men heaved water, ice, slush, whatever
the flying buckets scooped up, indiscriminately into the
yawning void inside that boiler; just as wearily, with aching
shoulders, Cole and his little group labored, unrelieved and
unshielded from the bitter cold on deck, heaving that barrel
up and down; while from the deckhouse, the more and more
frequent cries of <span class="smcap">Spell O!</span> showed that at the undermanned
pump, backs were fast giving way under that inhuman strain.</p>

<p>And in spite of all, I could see that we were going to lose.
Another hour yet to fill the boiler to the steaming level, but
from the rate with which the flood waters were still rising,
in another hour it would be too late—the water would be
over the grates. Hoping against hope that perhaps I was
wrong, that perhaps the water was going into that kettle
faster than I thought, I crawled myself to the top of the
boiler. Keeping as clear of Bartlett as the scant space allowed,
not to slow up the stream of buckets, I seized the torch
and in between the dumping of those cumbersome buckets
peered through the ice-rimmed manhole into that Scotch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
boiler. As I feared. The upper tubes down there were still
uncovered; the crown sheets of the furnaces were still perhaps
a foot above the level of the slush (I could hardly call
it water) line. As I looked, Bartlett, sprawled out beside me,
sent another bucketful splashing through the manhole, which
soaked my beard and almost immediately froze it into a
solid mass. But I hardly noticed it, staring with leaden eyes
into that still half-empty boiler. With a sinking heart, I slid
away on the ice-coated cylinder from the manhole, and
crawled down the breechings to stand once again on the
thickening ice covering the flooded floorplates.</p>

<p>Dare I fire up without waiting further?</p>

<p>I was in a terrible predicament. To light fires under a
partly filled boiler like that, with tubes and furnace plates
not wholly covered with water, was not only the surest way
to a courtmartial which would probably end my naval career,
it violated also every tenet in my engineer’s code, violated
every principle of safety, practically insured a boiler explosion!
But if I did not get fires going right away, I would
never have a chance to fire up, and not only that boiler but
the ship herself and all her crew besides would vanish in that
Arctic ice.</p>

<p>I must risk whatever came.</p>

<p>With flying buckets and tumbling barrel splashing and
spilling water all around me, I applied a match to another oil
torch, fanned it a moment in the chilly air till it blazed
brightly, shoved it (in the narrow space still remaining between
the flood waters and the grate bars) into the inboard
furnace under the kindling, till the wood took fire and then
hurriedly transferred it to the outboard furnace until that
also lighted off. The extreme cold of the outside air favored
me, creating a tremendous draft as soon as a little
warm air filled the flues, and in no time at all it seemed,
the wood was blazing up fiercely and igniting the coal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
which, shining brightly down through the grate bars onto
the water flooding the lower part of the ash-pits, cast a
lurid red glare out into the dark fireroom, evidently putting
new life into the drooping sailors, for both below and on
deck, a ragged cheer greeted that crimson glow.</p>

<p>“Keep that water going, lads; we haven’t won yet!” I
warned, flinging open the furnace doors and heaving in more
coal. “We’ve got to get that water level up over the crown
sheets before they get red hot, or we’re all going straight to
hell! Twice as fast now on those buckets!” And whatever it
was, fear or hope, that inspired those coalheavers, a moment
before ready to drop from utter exhaustion, the buckets
started to fly faster than ever.</p>

<p>I finished heaving coal, slammed to the fire doors, and leaned
back on my shovel. I was in for it now. Never in the history
of steam, before nor since, has a boiler been fired under such
weird conditions—furnaces half-flooded, no water showing
in the sight glasses, slush and ice for what charge there was,
and the boiler manhead still off! But I was relying on some
of those very dangers to save my bacon—till I put the manhole
cover back, there could be no pressure to cause real
trouble; and till we had melted down and warmed up that
ice and slush, I counted on that chilly mixture and the water
still splashing in to soak up heat so rapidly as to keep the bare
tubes and exposed crown sheets from getting red hot and
collapsing.</p>

<p>My other fears I need hardly go into—the dangers of
bringing up steam suddenly in a cold boiler instead of
gradually warming up first for twelve hours as was usual;
of frozen gauge glasses; of frozen feed pumps—all these I
deliberately put out of my mind. Only one thing counted
now—to get some steam at any cost whatever before the
water reached the grate bars and flooded out my fires.</p>

<p>And we did. With only a few inches left to go, came at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
last from Bartlett the long-awaited cry,</p>

<p>“The crown sheet’s covered now, chief!”</p>

<p>“On with that manhead!” I roared back.</p>

<p>The clanking of Bartlett’s sledge hammer, breaking away
the ice round the manhole so the cover would fit, was
my only answer. The worn-out coalheavers dropped their
buckets, rested for the first time in hours, sagging back
against the boiler fronts to keep from dropping into the icy
water. No time for that. I seized a slice bar, started savagely
to slice the fire in the outboard furnace, sang out,</p>

<p>“Boyd, get busy with another slice bar on that inboard
fire! Lauterbach, relieve Lee on filling that barrel! Lee, get
back to your pump now! And, Sharvell, you and Iversen,
get into those bunkers and break out some more coal! Come
to life now, all of you!”</p>

<p>Boyd, nearly dead from his half of heaving up over eight
tons of water, staggered over to my side, gripped a slice bar.
Together we labored over the fires, forcing them to the limit,
nursing in more coal without deadening the blaze, till helped
by an amazing draft from the stack, we had them roaring like
the very flames of hell itself. Never have I seen such fires!</p>

<p>Leaving the stoking job now wholly to Boyd, I dropped
my slice bar and stepped back to examine the gauge glasses.
Water was barely showing in the sight glass, but, thank God,
it was showing! And the needle of the pressure gauge was
starting to flutter off the zero pin. Steam was coming up!
If we could only hold down the flood for a few minutes more
now, till I could get that pump warmed up and going, we
were saved! But that part was up to Jack Cole.</p>

<p>“Jack!” I shouted up the hatch. “A little more and you can
quit. But right now, for God’s sake, shake it up; faster with
that barrel!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sor!” Then to his strangely conglomerate crew,
ready undoubtedly to collapse in their tracks, Cole called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
gruffly,</p>

<p>“C’mon me byes! Lit’s raylly git to liftin’ now, an’ work
up a sweat, or we’ll freeze to death in this cowld! Lay back
on ut, Starr! Heave there, Manson! Wud yez have thim two
Chinks outpullin’ yez? An’ step out there now, ye Chinese
seacooks, an’ don’t be clutterin’ up the decks, or whin that
Rooshian gits goin’, he’ll be treadin’ heavy on thim pigtails!
Yo heave! Up wid ut!” And with astonishing speed I saw the
loaded barrel vanish up the hatch.</p>

<p>I breasted my way through the water aft to where Lee in
the engine room stood by my largest steam pump. No need
to worry about priming the pump for suction; another foot
higher on that flood and we would have to go diving to reach
the pump valves. I felt the steam line. The frosty chill was
gone; a little steam at least was already coming through to
the pump.</p>

<p>“All right, Lee; let’s get going,” I mumbled. We cracked
open the steam valve a hair, started to drain the line. And
no mother nursing her baby ever handled it more tenderly
than Lee and I nursed that frozen pump, gradually draining
and warming the steam cylinder, lest the sudden application
of heat should crack into pieces that abnormally cold cast
iron, and after our heartbreaking struggle with the boiler,
leave us still helpless to eject the sea. With one eye on Jack
Cole’s rapidly moving barrel and the other on that narrowing
margin between flood water and furnace fires, I nursed
the pump along by feel, taking as long to warm it up as I
dared without swamping those flames. At long last the pump
cylinder was hot; steam instead of water was blowing out
the drains. And the boiler gauge needle stood at thirty
pounds. Enough; we could go.</p>

<p>I straightened up, motioned Lee to start the pump. He
opened the throttle valve. With a wheeze and a groan the
water piston broke free in its cylinder, the nearly submerged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
pump commenced to stroke.</p>

<p>Leaving Lee at the pump, I ran (that is, if barely dragging
one ice-weighted foot after another can be called running)
up the ladder toward the deck. While I climbed, the empty
barrel came hurtling down the hatchway, splashed into the
water in the fireroom. Before Lauterbach could fill and upend
it, down on top of the barrel in a maze of coils came the
slack end of the hoisting line. Apparently Cole’s gang was
through.</p>

<p>As I poked my head above the hatch into the open, there—Oh,
gorgeous sight for bleary eyes and aching muscles! was
a heavy stream of water pulsing into the scuppers! Nearby,
prone on the deck where they had dropped in their tracks
when they let go the hoisting line, were four utterly worn-out
seamen, gazing nevertheless admiringly on that beautiful
stream. And leaning against the bulwark watching it, was
Jack Cole, who as he saw me, sang out,</p>

<p>“Praises be, chief; we’re saved! There’ll be no calls for
<span class="smcap">Spell O</span> from that chap!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Our immediate battle was won, but the war thus opened that
19th of January, 1880, between us and the Arctic Sea for
the <em>Jeannette</em> dragged along with varying fortunes till the
last day I ever saw her.</p>

<p>Our big steam pump made short work of all the water in
the fireroom that was still water. In an hour the room was
bare down to ice-coated floors and bilges, with the pump
easily keeping ahead of the leakage coming from forward.
But the men at the hand pump, optimistically knocked off
the minute the steam pump began stroking, were unfortunately
not wholly relieved. Despite the fact that we opened
wide the gates in the forepeak and the forehold bulkheads
to let the water run freely aft to the fireroom pump, the flow
through was sluggish, impeded I suppose by having to filter
through the coal in the cross bunker. So fifteen minutes out
of every hour, the hand pump was manned again to keep
down the water level in the forehold, while, sad to contemplate,
our weary seamen, between spells at the pump, had to
labor in the forehold storerooms breaking out provisions
(much of which were already water soaked) and sending
them up into the deckhouse to save our food from complete
ruin.</p>

<p>It was ten-thirty in the morning when the leak was discovered;
it was three p.m. when I finally got steam up and
a pump going; but at midnight the whole crew was still at
work handling stores. The state we were then in was deplorable
beyond description.</p>

<p>Who struck eight bells that night I do not know, for since
morning we had had no anchor watch, but someone, Dunbar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
perhaps, whose seagoing habits were hard to repress,
snatched a moment from his task and manned the lanyard.
At any rate, as the clear strokes of the bronze bell rang out
on that frost-bitten night, De Long, in water up to his knees
in the forehold, was recalled to the passage of time. The
provisions actually in the water had been broken out; his
effort now was to send up all the remainder which rising
water might menace. But with the bell echoing in his ears,
the captain, looking at the jaded seamen about him, staggering
through the water laden with heavy boxes and casks,
toiling like mules, came suddenly to the realization that they
had only the limited endurance of men and called a halt.</p>

<p>“Knock off, lads,” he said kindly. “If anything more gets
wet before morning, it gets wet. Lay up on deck!” And on
deck, as the men straggled up the hatch to join the rest of
the crew round the hand pump (at the moment unmanned)
he ordered Cole to serve out all around two ounces of
brandy each. Frozen hands poured it into chilled throats, to
be downed eagerly at a gulp—there was not a man who might
not have swallowed a whole quart just as eagerly, and probably
then still have felt but little warmth in his congealed
veins.</p>

<p>At the captain’s order, Cole then piped down—the starboard
watch to lay below to their bunks, the port watch for
whom there was to be no immediate rest, to man the hand
pump as necessary through the remainder of that dreary
night, keeping the water in the forehold down below the
level of the as yet unshifted stores. The frozen seamen
tramped wearily off, some to rest if they could, the others to
bend their backs over the bars of the pump, which soon resumed
its melancholy clanking.</p>

<p>But neither for me, for the captain, nor for Chipp was
there any rest. Immediately I had downed my share of the
brandy, I turned to at once, figuring how I might get steam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
and a steam pump forward to suck directly on the forehold
and eliminate altogether the toil over the hand pump which
must soon break our men down. I had in my engine room that
spare No. 4 Sewell and Cameron pump (which my men and
I had so thoughtfully picked up in the dark of the moon at
Mare Island before we started). I set to work on a layout
for installing it in the deckhouse forward; which task, between
designing foundations and sketching out suction and
steam lines for it, kept me up the rest of the night. As for
Chipp, he was down in the forepeak with Nindemann, endeavoring
to stop, or at least to reduce, the leak. The water
was pouring in through the innumerable joints in that mass
of heavy pine timbers, which stretching from side to side and
from keel to berth deck in our bow, filled it for a distance of
ten feet abaft the stem. However valuable that pine packing
may have been in stiffening our bow for ramming ice, it was
now our curse, very effectively preventing us from caulking
whatever was sprung in the stem itself. All through the night
Nindemann and Chipp labored, stuffing oakum and tallow
into the joints of that packing where the jets of water
squirted through. It was discouraging work. As fast as their
numbed fingers rammed a wad of oakum into a leaking joint
and stopped the flow there, water spurted from the joints
above. Methodically through the night they worked in that
dismal hole with freezing water spraying out over them, following
up the leaks, caulking joint after joint, but when at
last they got to the top, plugging oakum into the final crack,
the water rose still higher and started to pour down their
necks from between the ceiling and the deck beams overhead
where they could not get to it. They could do no more. At
five a.m., each man a mass of ice, they came up, beaten.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, De Long, foreseeing the possibility of such
a contingency, had himself put in the rest of the night over
the ship’s plans, designing a watertight bulkhead to be built<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
in the forepeak just abaft that packing, so that if we could
not stop the leak, we could at least confine the flooding to
a small space forward and thus stop all pumping, either by
hand or steam.</p>

<p>In the early morning, after twenty-four hours of continuous
strain and toil, the three of us met again in the deckhouse,
I with my sketches for the pump installation, De Long
with his bulkhead plans, and Chipp with the bad news that
we had better get both jobs underway at once for he had
failed utterly to stop the leak. So we turned to.</p>

<p>I will not go into what we went through the week following—my
struggles with frozen lines, improper equipment,
and lack of men and tools for such a job. Suffice it to say
that after three days I got that auxiliary Sewell pump running
forward so that to the intense relief of the deck force,
their torture at the hand pumps ended altogether, and I was
able to keep the water in the forepeak so low that Sweetman
and Nindemann were enabled to start building the bulkhead.</p>

<p>From then on, Nindemann and Sweetman bore the brunt.
On these two petty officers, Sweetman, our regular carpenter,
and Nindemann, our quartermaster (but almost as good as a
carpenter) fell the entire labor of building that bulkhead. In
the narrow triangular space in the peak, they toiled hour
after hour, day after day, cutting, fitting, and erecting the
planking. William Nindemann, a stocky, thickset German,
was a perfect horse for work, apparently able to stand anything;
but Alfred Sweetman, a tall, spare Englishman, had
so little flesh on his ribs that he froze through rather rapidly,
and in spite of his objections, had to be dragged up frequently
to be thawed out or he would soon have broken
down completely. As it was, every four hours both men got
a stiff drink of whiskey to keep them limbered up, and as
much hot coffee and food in between as they could swallow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
which was considerable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during all this turmoil and anxiety, the captain
was weighed down with the problem of what to do with the
blinded Danenhower should the water get away from us,
either then or later. To add to his worries, Dunbar, who was
also still under the weather from his illness, seemed between
that and his efforts to assist, to have aged overnight at least
twenty years. It was pathetic to see the old man, looking
now positively decrepit, struggling in spite of the captain’s
orders to hold up his end alongside husky seamen, fighting
with them to help save the ship. And as if to make a complete
job of De Long’s mental anguish during that agonizing
first day of the leak, Surgeon Ambler was suddenly taken
violently ill, and to the captain’s great alarm had to be left
in his cabin, practically unattended. Aside from De Long’s
natural concern over what might happen to Ambler himself,
the effect on the captain’s mind of this prospect of being
left without a doctor to look after Danenhower and any
others who might collapse in our desperate predicament, can
well be imagined. It amazed me that the captain under the
combined impact of all these worries and disasters, instead
of caving in himself, maintained at least before the men an
indomitable appearance, by his actions encouraging them,
and with never a word of profanity, urging and cheering
them on.</p>

<p>By the end of the ensuing week things showed signs of improvement—I
had both steam pumps going, hand pumping
was discontinued, Nindemann and Sweetman against terrible
odds were making progress on the bulkhead, Dunbar was no
worse, and Ambler (whose trouble turned out to be his
liver) was under his own care, sufficiently on the mend to
be no longer in danger.</p>

<p>Only Danenhower, aside from our leak, remained as a
problem. He, instead of getting better, got worse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>The third day of our troubles, while I was still struggling
with a frozen steam whistle line through which I was trying
to get steam forward to start my Sewell pump, there into the
glacial deckhouse beside me came our surgeon, wan and
pinched and hardly able to drag one foot after another. I
gazed at him startled. He had not been out of his bunk since
his illness.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, brother?” I queried anxiously. “Why
aren’t you aft in your berth where you belong? We don’t
need help; we’re getting along here beautifully.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the captain?” he asked, ignoring my questions.
“I want him right away.”</p>

<p>“Below there,” I replied, pointing down the forepeak
hatch. “He’s inspecting the work on the bulkhead. Shall I
call him for you, doc?”</p>

<p>Apparently too weak to speak a word more than he had
to, Ambler only nodded. A little alarmed, I poked my head
down the hatch into the dark peak tank and called out to
De Long standing far below on the keelson. He looked up,
I beckoned him, and he started cautiously to climb the icy
ladder, shortly to be blinking incredulously through his
frosty glasses at Ambler, even more astonished than I at seeing
him out of bed. Ambler wasted no words in explanations
regarding his presence.</p>

<p>“It’s Danenhower, captain. I got up as soon as I could to
examine him. His eye’s so much worse today that if I don’t
operate, he’ll lose it! So I came looking for you to get your
permission first. You know how things stand with us all.”</p>

<p>The captain knew, all right. It was easy to guess, looking
into his harassed eyes as Ambler talked, what was going
through De Long’s mind—a sick surgeon, poor medical
facilities, a leaking ship, and the possibility of having the
patient unexpectedly thrust out on that terrible pack to face
the rigors of the Arctic, where with even good eyes in imminent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
peril of freezing in their sockets at 50° below zero,
what chance for an eyeball recently sliced open? All this
and more besides was plainly enough reflected in the skipper’s
woebegone eyes and wrinkling brows. De Long thought it
over slowly, then wearily shook his head.</p>

<p>“I can’t give permission, doctor. It’s not Dan’s eye alone;
it means his very life if we have to leave the ship soon. And
since it’s his life against his eye we’re risking, he ought to
have a voice in it. I can’t say yes; I won’t say no. Put it up
to Dan; let him decide himself.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir; I’ll explain it to him.” Dr. Ambler swung
about, went feebly aft, leaving the captain and me soberly
regarding each other.</p>

<p>“You’re dead right, captain; nobody but Dan should decide.
It’s too much of a load for another man to have on his
conscience if things go wrong.”</p>

<p>De Long, abstractedly watching Ambler hobbling aft,
hardly heard me. Without a word in reply, he turned to the
ladder behind him, and with his tall frame sagging inside
his parka as if the whole world bore on his bent shoulders,
haltingly descended it. I looked after him pityingly. He had
brought Dan, a husky, vital young man into the Arctic; now
of all times, what a weight to have on his mind as Dan’s life
hung in the balance! Unconsciously I groaned as I turned
back to thawing out my steam line and I am afraid that my
mind wandered considerably for the next hour as I played
a steam hose back and forth along that frozen length of iron
pipe.</p>

<p>I was still at it, and still not concentrating very well, when
Tong Sing’s slant eyes peered at me through the cloud of
vapor enveloping my head and he pulled my arm to make
sure he had my attention.</p>

<p>“Mister Danenhower likee maybe you see him, chief.”</p>

<p>I shut off my steam hose, nodded to the steward, started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
aft. If I could help to lighten poor Dan’s burden any, I was
glad to try. But what, I wondered, did he want of me—advice
or information?</p>

<p>I entered Dan’s room, sidling cautiously between the
double set of blankets draping the door to shut out stray
light. It was pitch-black inside.</p>

<p>“That you, chief?” came a strained voice through the
darkness the minute my foot echoed on the stateroom deck.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dan. What is it?”</p>

<p>“My eye’s in horrible shape, the doctor tells me, chief.
If it’s anything like the way it hurts, I guess he understates
it. What’s happened to make it worse the last couple of
days I don’t know,” he moaned, then added bitterly, “Most
likely it’s just worry. How do you think I feel lying here
useless, not lending a hand, while the rest of you are killing
yourselves trying to stop that leak and save the ship?”</p>

<p>I felt through the blackness for his bunk, then slid my
fingers over the blankets till I found his hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t let that get you, Dan,” I begged, giving his huge
paw a reassuring squeeze. “We’re making out fine with that
leak. As a fact, we got it practically licked already. It wasn’t
much trouble.”</p>

<p>“Quit trying to fool me, chief,” pleaded Dan. “It’s no
use. Maybe I can’t see, but I can hear! So I know what’s
going on around me. As long as I hear that hand pump clanking,
things are bad! And with the skipper’s cabin right over
my head and yours just across the wardroom and me lying
here twenty-four hours a day with nothing to do but listen,
don’t you think I know when you turn in? And neither of
you’ve turned in for a total of ten minutes in two nights
now! Don’t try to explain that away!”</p>

<p>I winced. Dan, in spite of the Stygian darkness in which
he lived, had the facts. No use glossing matters over.</p>

<p>“Listen, Dan, I’m not fooling you,” I answered with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
the earnestness I could muster. “It’s true we haven’t slept
much, but we’re both all right. And while things looked
pretty bad at first, for a fact, we got that leak practically
licked. Before the day’s over, that hand pump will shut down
for good. Now forget us and the ship; let’s get back to
Danenhower. What can I do for you, brother?” I gave his
palm a friendly caress.</p>

<p>I felt Dan’s invisible hand twitch in mine, then close convulsively
on my fingers.</p>

<p>“I’m in a tough spot, Melville. The doctor tells me if he
doesn’t operate, I’ll go blind. And if he does, and I have to
leave the ship before my eye’s healed and he can strip the
bandages, I’ll probably die! And it’s up to me to decide
which. Simple, isn’t it, chief?” Danenhower groaned. Had
I not kept my lips tightly sealed, I should have groaned also
at his pathetic question. With a lump in his throat, he added,
“I don’t want to go back blind to my f—,” he choked the
merest fraction of a second over the word, then substituting
another, I think, hastily finished—“friends, but as much as
anybody here I want to get back alive if I can. Honestly,
chief, you won’t fool a blind shipmate just to spare his feelings,
will you?” He gripped my hand fiercely. “What’re our
chances with the ship? I’ve got to know!”</p>

<p>“The leak’s licked, Dan,” I assured him earnestly. “We
won’t sink because of that. But about what the ice is going
to do to us, your guess is as good as mine. Seeing what she’s
fought off so far, I’d back the old <em>Jeannette’s</em> ribs to hold
out against the pack for a while yet.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, chief, for your opinion.” Dan pressed my hand
once more, then slowly relaxed his grip. “I guess I’ll have to
think it over some more before I decide. You’d better go
now; sorry to have dragged you so long from your work to
worry you over my poor carcass.”</p>

<p>I said nothing, I dared not, fearing that my voice would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
break. With big Dan stretched out blind and helpless on his
bunk, invisible there, to me only a voice and a groping hand
in the darkness, I slipped away silently, leaving him to grapple
with the choice—to operate or not to operate—possible
death in the first case, certain blindness in the second. And
with the knowledge that however he chose, the final answer
lay, not with him, but with the Arctic ice pack. He must
guess what it had in store for the <em>Jeannette</em> with his sight or
his life the forfeit if he guessed wrong. I went back to my
own trifling problem, thawing out the steam line.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, Tong Sing came forward again, calling
the captain this time, who immediately went aft. Whether
Danenhower had decided or whether he was seeking further
information, the steward did not know. I worked in suspense
for the next hour till De Long returned. One look at his face
informed me how Dan had decided.</p>

<p>“Well, brother, when’s the operation?”</p>

<p>“It’s over already, Melville! Successful too, the doctor
says. I watched it and helped a bit. And, chief, I hardly know
which to admire most—the skill and speed with which
Ambler, weak as he was, worked, or the nerve and heroic
endurance with which Dan stood it. He’s back in his stateroom
now, all bandaged again. God grant the ship doesn’t go
out from under us before those bandages are ready to come
off!”</p>

<p>Well, that was that. With a somewhat lighter heart, I resumed
blowing steam on my frozen line. De Long crawled
back into the forepeak to resume his study of the leak.</p>

<p>But my happier frame of mind did not last. If it was not
one thing on the <em>Jeannette</em> to drive us to distraction, it was
a couple of others. The captain soon squirmed back through
the hatch with a long face to join me again beside the deck
pump.</p>

<p>“How much coal have we got in our bunkers, now, chief?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
he asked.</p>

<p>“Eighty-three tons and a fraction,” I answered promptly.
I felt that I knew almost every lump of coal in our bunkers
by name, so to speak.</p>

<p>“And what are we burning now?” he continued.</p>

<p>“A ton a day, captain, to run our pumps and for all other
purposes, but as soon as that bulkhead’s finished and the
leak’s stopped, we ought to get down to 300 pounds again,
our old allowance.”</p>

<p>De Long shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“No, chief, we never will. The way the ship’s built, I see
now we’ll never get that bulkhead really tight; she’s going to
keep on leaking and we’re going to keep on pumping. But a
ton of coal a day’ll ruin us! By April, at that rate, the bunkers’ll
be bare. Can’t you do something, anything, to cut
down that coal consumption?”</p>

<p>I thought hastily. Our main boiler, designed of course for
furnishing steam to propel the ship, was far bigger than
necessary just to run a couple of pumps, and consequently
it was wasteful of fuel. If pumping, instead of lasting only
a few days more, was to be our steady occupation, I ought
to get some setup more nearly suited to the job. Before me
in the deckhouse was the little Baxter boiler I had rigged
for an evaporator. That might run the forward pump. And
looking speculatively aft through the deckhouse door, my
eye fell on our useless steam cutter, half buried in a mound
of snow and ice covering its cradle on the poop. There was
a small boiler in that cutter. Perhaps I could remove it, rig
it somehow to run a pump in the engine room. And then
I might let fires die out under the main boiler again and do
the job with less coal.</p>

<p>Briefly I outlined my ideas to the captain, who, willing to
clutch at any straw, gave blanket approval to my making
anything on the ship over into what I would, so long as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
promised to save some coal.</p>

<p>“Good, brother,” I promised. “As soon as I get this pump
running and knock off the hand pump, I’ll turn to with the
black gang and try to rig up those small boilers so we can
shut down that big coal hog. And even if we have to hook
up Ah Sam’s teakettle to help out on the steam, we’ll get
her shut down; you can lay to that!”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you will, chief,” answered De Long gratefully.
“Now is there any way we can help you out with the deck
force?”</p>

<p>“Only by plugging away on those leaks, captain. We’re
making 3300 gallons of salt water an hour in leakage; every
gallon of that you plug off means so much more coal left in
the bunkers.”</p>

<p>“I well appreciate that, Melville. Nindemann and his mate
are doing what they can with the bulkhead; I’m starting
Cole and the deck watch to shoving down ashes and picked
felt between the frames and the ceilings in the forepeak to
stop the flow of water there. We’ll get something on that
leak, I don’t know yet how much, but we’ll never get her
tight. I see that now.”</p>

<p>And De Long, looking (though he tried to conceal it) as
if that sight were breaking his heart, crawled back again to
the freezing forepeak. I felt strongly tempted to seize him
by the arm and start him instead for his bunk, but I was
afraid he would urge the same on me and I had to get that
line thawed and the Sewell pump going forward before I
knocked off, so I let him go.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">January dragged away, followed in dreary succession by
February, March, and April, and the <em>Jeannette</em> drifting aimlessly
with the pack, was still solidly frozen in. Our lives
were only a wearing repetition of what had gone before—fierce
cold, alarms, the roaring and tumbling of the ice pack,
tremendous squeezes and pressures from the floes, and night
and day the wheezing of the steam pumps, pumping, forever
pumping. It seemed almost a reasonable supposition to conclude
that we must have the whole Arctic Ocean nearly
pumped dry to judge by the length of time we had been
at it and by the huge masses of ice banked up against our
bulwarks and spreading out over the floes where the streams
of sea water flowing from our scuppers had frozen.</p>

<p>A few minor triumphs and reliefs we had, but not many.
In late January the sun came back over the horizon for the
first time in seventy-one days, to reveal that we had all
bleached strangely white in the long Arctic darkness. On the
mechanical side, I had succeeded, after many heartbreaking
disappointments, in supplanting the main boiler with the two
little ones; and that, aided by the never ending efforts of
Nindemann in plugging leaks (which had cut the hourly flow
nearly in half), had resulted in gradually reducing our coal
consumption to only a quarter of a ton a day. We shot a few
bears and a few seals, which gave a welcome variety to our
diet of salt beef and tasteless canned meat; we even had
hopes of knocking down some birds but there we were disappointed.</p>

<p>“No, Melville,” the captain gravely rebuked me, when
empty-handed I returned to the ship after a February tramp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
over the floes and pushed my shotgun disgustedly into the
rack, “birds have more sense than men. No bird with a well-regulated
mind would possibly trust himself out in this
temperature.”</p>

<p>On the debit side, the temperatures reached unbelievable
depths. 57° below zero was recorded by our thermometers
(the spirit ones, for the mercurial bulbs froze solidly at
around -40°). The pack ice reached thicknesses of thirty-five
and forty feet below the water where underrunning
floes, freezing together, consolidated into a kind of glacial
layer cake. Contemplation of these formations, measurable
whenever the floes near us cracked apart, gave a gloomy
aspect to the ship’s chances of ever getting free of the pack.
And the irregular and formidable surface of the pack also
gave us cause for thought, now that in the growing daylight
we could see in what state the upheaval of January 19th had
left the ice around us. Sledging across the pack was impossible;
as soon might one think of getting from the Bronx
to Brooklyn by dragging a team of dogs and a sledge over
the Manhattan housetops. Here and there, conditions were
even worse. Sharvell, with the impressionability of youth,
came in from an exploring trip with eyes popping to tell me,</p>

<p>“Say, chief, five miles north o’ ’ere, the ice is standing in
mountains ’igher nor our mast’eads!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sharvell, it’s quite likely.”</p>

<p>“Shall I tell the skipper, sir, or will you?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Why bother him about it?”</p>

<p>“If ’e knew, it’d save work, sir. ’E’d quit ’aving the bug’unter
clean an’ mount that big walrus ’ead with the tusks
that ’e’s so busy fixing up. ’Cause when that ice gets to us,
sir, we’re through, an’ it’ll be a terrible lot o’ work for us
sailors dragging that ’eavy walrus ’ead over the pack. ’E
better quit now, an’ ’e will, sir, when I tells ’im abaht them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
mountains of ice!”</p>

<p>But I told Sharvell to forget it, for I doubted that with
all his other worries, the captain would be much exercised
over mountains five miles off.</p>

<p>Aside from the aspect of the ice, we had troubles closer
home. Especially forward in the deckhouse and crew spaces,
the inside of the ship which now we had to keep above the
freezing point to save our pumps from damage, was damp
and disagreeable beyond expression, with moisture condensing
on all cold surfaces and dripping from the beams into
the men’s bunks.</p>

<p>Finally to deepen our gloom, Danenhower failed to respond
favorably to treatment, and the doctor had to perform
several more operations on his eye, coming at last to the conclusion
that Dan must, till we escaped from the ice, remain
a chronic invalid confined in darkness to his cabin, with no
great hope of saving his sight even should he then get back
to happier surroundings and decent hospital facilities.</p>

<p>Oddly enough through all this, after the first week’s struggle
with the leak, we continued our scientific and meteorological
observations. The captain clung to that routine as
to a lifeline, which perhaps to him mentally it was, constituting
his solitary claim to conducting a scientific expedition.
For of explorations and geographical discoveries there
were none; on the contrary instead of a steady drift northward
which might uncover new lands or at least get us to
higher latitudes, we shuffled aimlessly about with the pack,
occasionally drifting northward for some weeks to De Long’s
obvious delight, only to have the drift then reversed and to
his intense depression of spirits, to turn out some clear morning
to find himself gazing once again across the pack at the
familiar mountainous outline of the north side of distant
Wrangel Land. But after March, even this sight of far-off
land, depressing as it was from its associations, was denied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
us, for as the season advanced the pack, still zigzagging over
the polar sea as aimlessly as ever, failed to get quite so far
south again; from that time on we saw land no more and
the world for us became just one vast unbroken field of
broken ice.</p>

<p>Only one hope kept us going. No one really knew what
happened to that moving pack in summer time—no one before
us had ever wintered in it, involuntarily or otherwise.
So we lived on in the expectation that as the days lengthened
and the thermometer rose above zero, summer weather and
the long days under the midnight sun would sufficiently melt
the ice to break up the pack, and if by then we still had any
coal left, permit us to do some little exploring northward
before with bare bunkers we loosed our sails and in the early
fall laid our course homeward.</p>

<p>In that spirit then, we cheerfully greeted the advent of
May, and as if to justify our confidence, May Day burst upon
us with gorgeous weather—no clouds, and glistening at us
across the ice a brilliant sun which even at midnight still
peeped pleasantly over the horizon, and a temperature which
in mid-afternoon reached the unbelievable height of 30° F.,
only two degrees below freezing. We were positively hot.
All hands (except of course Danenhower) turned out on the
ice to bask in the sunshine, with the queer result that many
of us came back aboard with our complexions sunburned
to a fiery red and unable at first to believe it. Our hopes
started to mount; if the sun could do that to such weather-beaten
frost-bitten hides as ours, what would it not do to
the ice imprisoning us? Release was seemingly just around
the corner of the calendar—by June 1 at the outside, say.</p>

<p>But meanwhile, awaiting that happy event, the captain
prudently ordered (lest more casualties go to join the luckless
Danenhower) that snow goggles be worn on all occasions
by all hands except when actually below on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
ship.</p>

<p>So May moved along, made notable mainly by a positive
flood of bears, which daily kept us on the jump. The bears,
ravenous with hunger after a long winter, were attracted
to the <em>Jeannette</em> by mingled scents, mainly canine, which to
their untutored nostrils probably meant food. But we had
long since lost any fear of ice bears and the dogs apparently
never had any, so the cry of—</p>

<p>“Bear ho!”</p>

<p>was the immediate signal for whoever had the captain’s permission
(which now meant practically anyone off watch) to
seize a rifle from the rack placed conveniently at the gangway,
and be off. We became so contemptuous of the bears,
that we chased them even with revolvers, and if necessity had
arisen, would no doubt have done so barehanded, for I have
never seen a bear which would rush a man. Except when
brought to by the dogs, with a man in sight all that ever
interested the bear was to get behind the nearest hummock or
into an open lead, where swimming with only his nose above
water, he could escape the rain of bullets from our Remingtons
and Winchesters. The vitality of the bears was amazing.
Unless filled so full of lead that the mere weight of the
bullets as ballast slowed them down enough for the dogs to
bring them to a stand where a close range shot into the brain
finished them off, they usually got away.</p>

<p>We had queer experiences with the bears. On one occasion,
exploring one of the narrow leads in the pack about
a quarter of a mile from the ship, the captain was sculling
unconcernedly along in the dinghy when he found himself
facing an ice bear not a hundred feet off. Wholly unarmed,
De Long regarded the bear with dismay. He could not run,
for over broken ice he was no match in speed for Ursus;
besides he was in a boat, which prevented running away, for
while the water was an obstacle to him, to the bear it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
merely the most convenient means of transportation. Inquisitively
the bear advanced; De Long, unable to do anything
else, sat and stared, trying out the power of the human eye
as a defence. The bear, only fifty feet off, still approached,
sniffing curiously and De Long, short-sighted though he
was, said he could clearly make out where the short hairs
ended at the edge of the bear’s beautiful black nose. The
captain quickly concluded there was nothing in hypnosis
as applied to polar bears. So gripping his oar, prepared to
fend off the bear should he approach closer to the boat, he
sang out lustily,</p>

<p>“Ship there! A bear! A bear!”</p>

<p>At this, the bear, more puzzled than ever, sat down on the
ice to contemplate De Long and was still seriously thinking
him over, trying to make him out, when a pack of dogs hove
into sight from under the <em>Jeannette’s</em> stern, followed by
several seamen, and off lumbered the bear.</p>

<p>So long as we had the <em>Jeannette</em> under us, the plethora
of bears meant at most only a break in the monotony of
our existence and a welcome change in our salt beef diet.
Should we have to abandon ship, however, they offered a
ray of hope. For convinced now that we could never drag
across the upheaved pack pemmican enough to keep us from
starvation till we reached Siberia, we looked on the bears
as a possible source of fresh meat on the hoof which we
might with a little luck knock over as we went along and
thus keep life in our bodies.</p>

<p>The only other springtime event to compare with the
bears was a brilliant idea which struck De Long.</p>

<p>While he never discussed his family with me or with anyone,
De Long, alone among the ship’s company which had
sailed from San Francisco, had a wife and a child to occupy
his thoughts. I have no doubt that frequently in the dreary
months when I saw him, as I did one morning, abstractedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
gazing out over the pack, his mind was far away from us,
perhaps dwelling on that moment in the tossing whaleboat off
the Golden Gate when Emma De Long had to the last possible
instant clung round his neck in her farewell kiss. Drifting
backward down the years from that, his thoughts on
this morning evidently got to the days of his youth as an
ensign aboard the U.S.S. <em>Canandaigua</em>. While cruising
through the Channel ports, he had amongst the dikes and
mills of northern France and Holland courted Emma Wotton,
and as he thought of that landscape, so different from
the ice-fields round the <em>Jeannette</em>, his keen mind saw a connection.
He waved me to join him.</p>

<p>“Melville,” he asked, obviously off again on the one ever-present
topic, coal, “what’ll you do to keep your pumps
going when the coal’s all gone?”</p>

<p>I pointed aloft.</p>

<p>“Cut down our masts and spars and burn them,” I replied.
“They’re useless anyway.”</p>

<p>“And when they’ve gone too, what then?” De Long’s
clear blue eyes gazed at me fixedly, as if he had me there.</p>

<p>“Break up our bulwarks, the deckhouses, and the main
deck, and shove those into the fires too. They’ll all burn
fine.”</p>

<p>“And after that, what?” he asked relentlessly, puffing away
on his ever-present pipe.</p>

<p>“I guess then we abandon what’s left of the <em>Jeannette</em> and
take to the ice, captain. I’ll admit I can’t keep any boilers
going while I’m cutting the foundations out from under
them for firewood. When the main deck’s gone, I guess
we’re through.”</p>

<p>De Long looked gravely at me through his glasses, bent
his head a little to shield his pipe from the cold wind sweeping
the deck, and irrelevantly asked me,</p>

<p>“Melville, have you ever been in Holland?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“Why—yes,” I mumbled, taken aback at his sudden change
of front. “I guess it’s tulip time there now, captain. And
quite a different scene from all this ice that’s sprouting round
us in the merry springtime here. Why?”</p>

<p>“I was there in the springtime once also,” parried the
captain. “Lovely scene. I just wonder if we couldn’t make
the scenery round here resemble Holland in the springtime
a little better. You remember the tulips, eh, chief? Do you
by any chance remember anything else in the Dutch landscape—some
windmills, for instance?”</p>

<p>And then a great light dawned on me. I looked at my
captain with added respect. What did the Dutch have all
those thousands of windmills for except to meet the same
problem we faced—to pump water!</p>

<p>“Ah, you see it, do you?” asked the captain, gratified.
“Melville, can you rig up a windmill here to run our pumps?”</p>

<p>“Can do, brother!” I exclaimed enthusiastically. “I’ll turn
to on it right away; before long you’ll see a windmill going
round here in the Arctic to beat the Dutch!”</p>

<p>This job was rather intricate for our facilities, windmills
not being exactly in a sailor’s line, but aided by Lee, machinist,
and Dressler, blacksmith, we contrived it. Lee
especially was a great help, which might seem somewhat surprising,
for having been shot through both hips in the second
day’s fighting while helping Grant drive back Beauregard
at Shiloh, Lee was rather slow and unsteady on his feet.
But there was nothing the matter with his hands and he soon
had Dressler’s crude forgings turned up in our lathe into a
crankshaft and connecting rods, so that by the time Sweetman
had made the wooden arms of the windmill, we were
ready to go. Paradoxically, the one thing which on a ship
we were best prepared to furnish, the sails themselves, failed
to work well on our first trial. The mill occasionally hung on
the center because the heavy canvas sails sagged too much to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
hold the wind. Chipp, responsible for making the sails,
watched them in pained silence, but having no canvas more
suitable, soon rectified the matter in a novel manner. Sending
Noros and Erichsen down on the ice, he had them collect
some dozens of the empty meat cans littering the ice
floes, and beating these out flat, he laced them together with
wire, and soon had our mill-arms covered with fine metal
sails! Impelled by these, our windmill, mounted on the starboard
wing of the bridge, was soon rotating merrily and,
connected by a special rig to a bilge pump in the fireroom,
was pushing overboard in grand style all our leakage. So
well did it work, that we quickly were enabled to shut down
the steam cutter’s boiler, leaving only the little Baxter boiler
going for distilling and in case the wind died down (which
in the pack it rarely did) for unavoidable steam pumping.</p>

<p>So to our intense relief as spring drew on to its close, we
got our coal consumption down again to 300 pounds a day,
as it had been before that leak started to chew into our
bunkers in such ravenous fashion. Which was a very fortunate
thing for us, for with only sixty tons of coal left to
go on, our days on the <em>Jeannette</em> would indeed otherwise
have been numbered. Not least among the blessings which resulted
was the improved cheerfulness of De Long at this
success. He once more began to have some hope that when
the ice broke up, we would have coal enough to do some
exploring, so that he might again without too much shame
on his return face our sponsor’s sister, Miss Bennett, the
ship’s godmother, the “Jeannette” whose name we bore.</p>

<p>As the long days dragged out under the May sun, we
eagerly watched the floes, noting with satisfaction the increasing
number of rivulets coursing toward every crack
and hole in the pack, and how under the intense sunlight,
the cinders and ashes about the ship fairly seemed to burrow
their way down into the snow. (Watching the striking manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
in which everything dark soaked up the sunshine and
settled, De Long half-humorously suggested that we all take
a day off and pray for some miracle which might make all
the snow and ice about us black and thus hasten its disappearance.)</p>

<p>And so we came to May 31, to our discouragement still
held in the unbroken pack which, as measurements close
about us showed, was still four feet thick. We decided to
defer the day of our liberation to July 1, giving the sun another
month to work on the ice. But to damp our spirits,
June 1, the first day of summer as we reckoned it, opened
in a snow storm which continued through June 2 also, accompanied
by a heavy gale which drove the snow, soft and
mushy now, along in horizontal sheets.</p>

<p>When the snow finally ceased, the captain, optimistic
again, began to prepare for the day of our release. First of
all, fires were discontinued in the stoves fore and aft, thus
saving a little coal. Next, all hands and the cook were turned
to on knocking down our portable deckhouse and clearing
the main deck, so that looking like a ship once more, we might
be able to spread sails and get underway when the wind
served (provided, of course, the ice let go of us first). Several
days’ hard work accomplished this task, and with the topside
shipshape again, we needed only to hang our rudder
to be fully ready to go, but here again we had to wait on the
ice which still clung solidly to our rudder post.</p>

<p>Below, I got my machinery and boilers in shape to move.
With no fear of dangerous temperatures any more, I connected
up all piping, moved the engines by hand, secured
all cylinder heads, and filled both boilers to the steaming
level (through the sea cocks this time), and started generally
to clean up the machinery spaces. For a small black gang,
only six all told, this was slow work, so to avoid being
caught with the pack suddenly parting and my machinery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
not ready to turn over, I pushed my gang hard. Consequently
I was doubly annoyed when I noted several times
that Nelse Iversen, one of my coalheavers and ordinarily a
willing enough worker, showed decided signs of soldiering
whenever my back was turned. I cautioned Bartlett who had
charge of his watch, to get Iversen started, but after another
hour, seeing he still tended to hide in the bunkers rather
than scale rusty floorplates, I yanked Iversen up sharply
for it.</p>

<p>“Come to now, Nelse, and get behind that scaling hammer!
Or will it take a little extra duty to keep you out of
that bunker and on the job?”</p>

<p>Iversen, now that I got a closer look at him, looked queer
in the eyes, so when, his slow mind having digested my
statement, he finally answered, I was quite ready to believe
him.</p>

<p>“Ay tank, chief, Ay work so hard Ay can. Ay ban sick
man. My belly, she ache bad!”</p>

<p>“So, eh?” I said sympathetically. “Why didn’t you tell
Bartlett that an hour ago? Go up and see the doctor right
away. What ails you, diarrhoea again?”</p>

<p>“No; de odder way.”</p>

<p>“Constipation, huh? Well, you’re lucky. On this bucket,
that’s a better thing to have than diarrhoea any day. Go up
to the doctor and get some castor oil. And don’t come back
till it’s quit working.” I eased him over toward the fireroom
ladder, and started him on his way toward Ambler.</p>

<p>But after a day had elapsed, I began to wonder whether
the doctor’s castor oil had somehow been affected by the
cold or whether my coalheaver had evaded swallowing his
dose, for Iversen still showed the same tendency to shirk
work and hide in the bunkers in spite of Bartlett’s frequently
breaking him out of there. So taking Iversen in hand myself,
I escorted him up to the dispensary to see personally that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
there was no foolishness about his taking his medicine, and
calling Tong Sing, I sent him off to find the doctor who was
out on the ice.</p>

<p>The minute Tong Sing disappeared, Iversen poked his
head out the door, looked both ways quickly, then as if
satisfied, hastily shut the door and to my complete bewilderment,
stealthily approached me, cupped his hands over my
ear and whispered,</p>

<p>“Chief, Ay no ban sick, Ay ban vatched! Dere ban mutiny
on foot here!”</p>

<p>Mutiny? I stared at Iversen incredulously. The men were
having a veritable hell in their life there in the Arctic, but
what could they gain by mutiny? And who would lead it?
For an instant I had a vague suspicion, but I resolutely put
that out of my mind. Preposterous! I looked at Iversen intently.
But there could be no doubt as to his sincerity. He
was serious, all right.</p>

<p>I pushed him down into a chair, ordered sharply,</p>

<p>“Wait there, Nelse! I’ll get the captain!” and closing the
door behind me, I shot out of the dispensary and across the
cabin to the captain’s stateroom forward in the poop. Fortunately
De Long was there, writing in his journal.</p>

<p>“Come with me, skipper. I want you to hear something.
Right away!”</p>

<p>Puzzled unquestionably at my haste, De Long dropped
his pen, put down his meerschaum pipe, stretched his six-foot
frame up out of his chair, and reached for his parka.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t need that, captain; just as you are. We’re
only going to the dispensary.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. Who’s hurt now?”</p>

<p>“Nobody, but come along!” I started back for the dispensary
with De Long following, puffing leisurely at the
retrieved meerschaum which was his greatest comfort and
his inseparable companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>Iversen started up from his chair as we entered, saluted
the captain, and again swiftly scanned the cabin outside before
he closed the door.</p>

<p>“Now, Nelse, tell the captain,” I said briefly.</p>

<p>Once more Iversen cupped his hands, whispered into the
captain’s ear. De Long’s jaw dropped abruptly. His pipe fell
from his mouth and only by a quick lunge did I save it from
hitting the deck. But insensible to that, De Long, immovable,
only stared at Iversen, searching his face as I had done.
Finally he shook his head, muttered,</p>

<p>“It just can’t be! Where’d you get this, Iversen?”</p>

<p>“Yah, cap’n. Ay tal you it ban yust lak Ay say! Ay ban
asked to yoin. Ay no say, Yah; Ay no say, No; so Ay ban
vatched clost. Dey kill me for’ard if Ay tal!”</p>

<p>De Long looked at me. I handed him back his pipe, which,
wholly unconscious of his action, he took.</p>

<p>“What do you make of this, chief? It looks serious if
Iversen’s right!”</p>

<p>“Sounds crazy to me, but it might be so. Depends on
who’s in it and how many. The men are all armed, you
know. The rifle rack’s right at the gangway. Anybody can
help himself, and lots of ’em are out on the ice, guns in
hand this minute. But why they should want to mutiny, I
can’t see, unless the ice has affected their minds.”</p>

<p>Shocked at Iversen’s report; impressed by the gravity of
the situation if Iversen were right, for there already with
weapons in their hands were the mutineers, the captain still
looked skeptically at my grimy coalheaver. Why should his
crew mutiny? But on the other hand, what had Iversen to
gain by lying about it? And Iversen, a steady man, always
carefully attentive to his duty, was just the type of seaman
who might be trusted to stand with his captain at all hazards.</p>

<p>“Well,” said De Long grimly, “let’s get into this! Now,
Iversen, who’s behind it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>But there the captain ran into a stone wall. Iversen, very
nervous now, became evasive, dodged the questions, and
apparently in mortal fear of his life, refused to name the
mutineers, repeating only over and over again how, for two
days, he had been closely watched. Threats, promises, got
nothing more out of him. Finally the captain, baffled, took
a new tack.</p>

<p>“See here, Iversen, they can’t hurt you, and nobody else’ll
get hurt either if you tell. I can manage it then. There are
eight officers here; surely there are some of the crew will
join us! I’ll get all the mutineers, if you’ll name them, out on
the ice on some pretext. I don’t care if they do go armed.
Then we’ll haul in the gangway and from behind the bulwarks
we can hold the ship! A couple of nights freezing on
that ice will bring them round, all right! They’ll come cringing
back, hands in the air, begging to be taken aboard. Out
with it now! Who’s the leader?”</p>

<p>Iversen, more nervous than ever, shuffled to the door,
opened it a crack to assure himself no one was eavesdropping
outside, then faced us, and tremblingly blurted out,</p>

<p>“Sharvell!”</p>

<p>An amazing change came over the captain. He dropped
into a chair, roared with laughter.</p>

<p>“Sharvell? That’s rich! That lad? He’s not even a man
yet! Nobody’d follow him in a mutiny any more than a
child! Hah, hah!” But abruptly he stopped laughing, for
Iversen was now weeping hysterically, tears running down
his coal-stained cheeks. Soberly De Long looked at him,
then took me by the sleeve, pulled me aside a little, and
whispered,</p>

<p>“I guess the mutiny on the <em>Jeannette’s</em> over, chief. I
thought there was somebody crazy in it, and now I know
who. Send for the doctor, quick! I’ll stay here with Iversen.”
He started to light his pipe again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve already got the steward out looking for him, captain,”
I replied. “Ambler ought to be here any minute. And
I guess you’re dead right, brother! Poor Iversen!”</p>

<p>It was so. Immediately Surgeon Ambler came aboard, we
turned the weeping coalheaver over to him. An hour later,
when, after a careful examination, Iversen under Cole’s surveillance
had been led forward, he confirmed our fears.
Iversen, if not already insane, was trembling on the border
of it. Only observation over several days could prove which.
De Long, much relieved at first by freedom from dread of
any mutiny, was nevertheless badly enough depressed by
the doctor’s report.</p>

<p>“First a blinded officer,” he muttered, “now a crazy seaman!
What’ll this ice do to us next?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">June 21st came, the longest day in the year. Further south,
to ordinary people, that meant more daylight; to us, with
daylight twenty-four hours every day, it meant only that the
sun stood on the Tropic of Cancer, having reached his most
northerly declination. Ruefully we considered that. The sun
was as far north as possible, as high in our heavens as he
would ever get, though even so, at noon he stood not so
high, only about 40° above the horizon. We would never
receive his rays any more direct; instead, from now on they
would become even more slanting, and less hot as he went
south. And we were still held in the ice. Our case for release
began to look less hopeful, and we went around that
day with cheerless faces. Long afterward, picked out of the
Siberian snows, I salvaged the captain’s journal and looking
through it was particularly impressed by what he put down
for June 21, 1880. So aptly did he express the situation and
our feelings of desolation that day, that I repeat it here.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">
“June 21st, 1880. Monday.<br>
</p>

<p>“Discouraging, very. And yet my motto is ‘Hope on,
hope ever.’ A very good one it is when one’s surroundings
are more natural than ours; but situated as we are it
is better in the abstract than in realization. There can be
no greater wear and tear on a man’s mind and patience
than this life in the pack. The absolute monotony; the
unchanging round of hours; the awakening to the same
things and the same conditions that one saw just before
losing one’s self in sleep; the same faces; the same dogs;
the same ice; the same conviction that tomorrow will be
exactly the same as today, if not more disagreeable; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
absolute impotence to do anything, to go anywhere, or to
change one’s situation an iota; the realization that food is
being consumed and fuel burned with no valuable result,
beyond sustaining life; the knowledge that nothing has
been accomplished thus far to save this expedition from
being denominated an utter failure; all these things crowd
in with irresistible force on my reasoning power each night
as I sit down to reflect on the events of the day, and but
for some still small voice within me that tells me this can
hardly be the ending of all my labor and zeal, I should be
tempted to despair.</p>

<p>“All our books are read, our stories related; our games
of chess, cards, and checkers long since discontinued.
When we assemble in the morning at breakfast, we make
daily a fresh start. Any dreams, amusing or peculiar, are
related and laughed over. Theories as to whether we shall
eventually drift northeast or northwest are brought forward
and discussed. Seals’ livers as a change of diet are
pronounced a success. The temperature of the morning
watch is inquired into, the direction and velocity of the
wind, and if it is snowing (as it generally is) we call it
a ‘fine summer day.’ After breakfast, we smoke. Chipp
gets a sounding and announces a drift east-southeast or
southeast, as the case may be. We growl thereat. Dunbar
and Alexey go off for seals with as many dogs as do not
run away from them <em>en route</em>. The doctor examines Danenhower
and Iversen, his two chronic patients. Melville
draws a little for this journal, sings a little, and stirs everybody
up to a realization that it is daytime. Danenhower
(from his stateroom) talks incessantly—on any and all subjects,
with or without an audience. The doctor moralizes
between observations; I smoke; Mr. Newcomb makes his
preparations for dredging specimens; Mr. Collins has not
appeared, his usual hour being 12:30 in the afternoon.
Meanwhile the men have been set at work; a sled and dogs
are dispatched for the day’s snow for washing purposes.
The day’s rations are served out to the cook, and then we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
commence to drift out on the ice to dig ditches, to look at
the dogs, calculate the waste in the ice since yesterday, and
the probable amount by tomorrow. The dredge is lowered
and hauled. I get the sun at meridian, and we go to dinner.
After dinner, more smoke, more drawing, more singing,
more talk, more ditch and canal-making, more hunting,
more dog inspection, and some attempts at napping
until four p.m., when we are all around for anything that
may turn up. At 5:30 time and azimuth sight, post position
in cabin, make chart, go to supper at six, and discuss
our drift, and then smoke, talk and general kill-time occupations
till ten p.m., when the day is ended. The noise
subsides; those who can, go to bed; I write the log and
my journal, make the observations for meteorology till
midnight. Mr. Collins succeeds me four hours, Chipp him
four hours, the doctor next four hours, Mr. Collins next
six hours, I next two hours, Melville next two hours, and
I end the day again, and so it goes.</p>

<p>“Our meals necessarily have a sameness. Canned meat,
salt beef, salt pork, and bear meat have the same taste at
one time as another. Each day has its bill of fare, but
after varying it for a week we have, of course, to commence
over again. Consequently we have it by heart, and
know what we are going to get before we sit down at
table. Sometimes the steward startles us with a potato salad
(potatoes now rotting too fast for our consumption), or
a seal’s liver, or a bear’s tongue; but we generally are not
disturbed in that way. Our bill of fare is ample and good,
our water is absolutely pure, and our fresh bread is something
marvelous. Though disappointed day after day we
are cheerful and healthy, and—here we are.”</p>
</div>

<p>And to all that I can fervently say “Amen!”</p>

<p>June on the whole was chilly and disagreeable. The
temperature rarely got above 32° F., and yet in spite of that
the ice did keep on wasting, from direct absorption of sunlight,
of course. The ship came up somewhat through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
softening ice to a lighter draft, owing to our considerable
consumption of coal and stores since late November when
we were frozen in after our transit of the ice-canal. But as
an offset to this cheering rise, she heeled gradually more to
starboard, adding to our discomfort.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, De Long kept Dunbar, who naturally was
a good walker, scouting far and wide over the pack looking
for open leads, which might promise a break-up of the
pack and a chance of escape through one of them. June 28th,
Dunbar, duck-hunting in the dinghy in a little lead about a
mile from the ship, came back in the late afternoon with
thirteen ducks, but with what was far more exciting, the
news that the lead had suddenly opened up, that he had
followed it (open here and there to a width of half a mile)
at least fifteen miles before turning round. And from there it
still stretched northward as far as he could see!</p>

<p>De Long was immediately all excitement. If only we could
get the <em>Jeannette</em> across that single mile of solid ice between,
there was no telling how far north we might go along that
lead! He dragged Chipp into his cabin and went over with
him the possibilities of blasting out the intermediate ice.
While Chipp was calculating how far our supply of gunpowder
would take us, De Long, eager to size up the situation
on the spot, hastily departed to examine the lead for
himself.</p>

<p>About midnight, he came back into the cabin, tossed his
parka onto the table. Chipp, surrounded by a sea of papers
containing his computations on the explosive powers of gunpowder,
handed the captain a sheet containing his conclusions.
De Long pushed it aside without even a glance.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Chipp, we won’t need it. I got there just in
time to watch that lead close up so tight you can’t get a
toothpick into it now! At least I had the melancholy satisfaction
of realizing that if the <em>Jeannette</em> had been there, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
would in all probability have been in for a very fine squeezing!”</p>

<p>And so June ended. We were still in the ice. Danenhower,
thin and bleached, was worse. Iversen seemed to be improved;
while still occasionally hysterical, his delusions of mutiny
were no longer obvious.</p>

<p>July came and went. We dressed ship on July 4 in a thick
fog and a chilling mist. The flags came down at midnight
(there was no sunset) all covered with frost. Rain, mist, and
fog were general. Our hopes for what the summer sun would
do for us began to fade. And even the few glimpses we got
of the sun, instead of cheering the captain up, further irritated
him. For De Long being now navigator and having
finally after days of delay got a shot at the sun on meridian
for latitude, hopeful that the drift had carried us north,
glanced at his sextant only to exclaim in anguish,</p>

<p>“Look at that altitude! All the sun shows me is how much
closer I’m getting to the South instead of to the North Pole!
If ever a man had justification for profanity, this southerly
drift is it! The Bible says that Job had many trials and
tribulations which he bore with wonderful patience, but I’ll
bet he was never caught in pack ice! Nor drifted south when
the wind was blowing north! But then Job’s may have been
an ante-glacial period!” De Long picked up his pipe and
nearly bit the stem in half. But a puff or two of tobacco
partly, at least, restored his equanimity. Putting his sextant
back in its case, he remarked to Chipp, also engaged in shooting
the sun,</p>

<p>“I suppose we might as well look at it philosophically. As
Jack says, ‘It’s all in a cruise, boys; the more days, the more
dollars!’”</p>

<p>July ended, and we were still in the ice. Such a miserable
month we were glad to be rid of.</p>

<p>August opened. Looking back over two thirds of the spent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
summer, with the highest temperature only 38° F. on the hottest
day, all hands began to despair. So also, I think, did the
captain, for he changed the schedule for taking meteorological
observations, requiring them only once every three hours
instead of hourly.</p>

<p>We came to the middle of the month, with the only change
in our condition an increase in our heel to 7-1/2°, a change
indeed in something, but not an improvement. We began to
get morose—summer was fast fading, we were not released,
and our hopes of doing anything in 1880 or in any succeeding
year were vanishing into space. I tried to cheer the mess
up by singing (if I say it myself, for an engineer I have a
very good voice), Irish songs and ditties having been my
specialty since early in my Civil War days on blockade.
Whether I cheered up anyone except myself with the sound
of my voice, I do not know, but I did get some sullen looks
for my efforts from Collins, who being Irish himself may
have thought I failed to do justice to the songs of his native
land. Collins (who also imagined <em>he</em> could sing) reciprocated
by regaling us with melodies from <em>Pinafore</em>, then only
two years old, but I thought he did the English far more
violence than I did the Irish. In this conclusion, I have as independent
evidence the reactions of Newcomb, who, whenever
I sang in the cabin, continued reading wholly oblivious
of me, but whenever Collins opened up on <em>Pinafore</em>, immediately
closed his book and remembered that he had a gull or
a seal that required stuffing.</p>

<p>As August dragged along, the little pools of water covering
the floes round about the ship now began to give us real
cause for depression by freezing over at night with a skin
of ice which failed to melt until the next noon. When that
commenced, what chance was left for the sun to have any
effect on floes still thirty and more feet in thickness?</p>

<p>And to add to our woes, we found that as a result of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
southerly and easterly drifting, we had been steadily going
backward. We were much closer to our starting point, Herald
Island, in late August than we had been in early May.
A whole summer’s drifting in the pack, and for a Polar Expedition,
we had got worse than nowhere!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the wearing days crawled by and we chafed
at our impotence—well, well-equipped and eager to do something,
we lay idle. I could have chewed nails for a change;
our captain was even more ambitious—entering his cabin one
evening with a sketch for his journal, he looked at me and
asked abruptly,</p>

<p>“Know Hamlet, chief? No? Well, for something to do, like
Hamlet I can say,</p>

<p>“‘Wouldst drink up eisel? Eat a crocodile? I’ll do it!’</p>

<p>“And so I would, chief, if there were any eisel and a few
crocodiles in our stores, and by so doing I could change our
position to one of usefulness. Well, what have you got there
for my journal? Another sketch of this eternal ice?”</p>

<p>August 31st, the last day of summer, came and went. We
were still fast in the pack. As a confirmation that summer
was gone, we saw again that evening for the first time in
months a faint aurora in the sky. De Long climbed to the
crow’s-nest with a telescope, took a look around. A desert of
ice in all directions, nothing but ice, ice, ice! He came down
from aloft, all hope of release gone. Calling the carpenter, he
ordered him to commence preparing our portable deckhouse
for re-erection. Sending for me, he asked me to accompany
him on a tour of the bunkers, to reassure himself, no doubt,
on the coal question. Together, lighting our way with oil
torches, we clambered through the dusty bunkers, the captain
checking by eye my statements of the quantity in each one.
Coming out, De Long musing over the figures, declared feelingly,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“God forbid anything happens to make us go back to steam
pumping. Only fifty-three tons of coal—an equal weight in
diamonds would not tempt me to exchange! For that coal,
chief, has got to last us through another winter in the pack!”</p>

<p>Only <em>another</em> winter? What reason, I wondered, had he
for supposing the end of a second winter would find us any
closer to release? But the pack had far from exhausted its
versatility, as I soon enough found out.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">September 1st came, and winter fell on us like a blanket.
Snow, low temperatures, and the prompt freezing over of all
stray pools with a coat of ice that failed to melt again gave
the pack an immediate wintry appearance that only deepened
as the month drew on. September 6th, the anniversary
of our being first frozen in, opened our second year in the
pack, with the only change noticeable the fact that winter
had set in earlier and harder. But of course our present position,
a hundred and fifty miles north of that of the year
before, might easily have accounted for that.</p>

<p>September drifted by. October came. The temperatures
dropped into the sub-zero twenties. We noted only that we
were less sensitive to cold than the year before—luckily for us,
for apparently we were in for a worse freezing. All hands,
officers and men, became more moody, less talkative. By now
it was evident to even the dullest-witted that we might go
on thus forever in the ice pack; that is, at least till death in
one form or another—by starvation, when our food gave out;
by freezing, when we exhausted our coal; or by the ice crushing
our weak bodies at any time—put a period to our tale.
To talk further about what the expedition would do when
the ice released us seemed just a waste of breath. The ice was
not going to release us.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in spite of our dreary outlook, we had to stick
to the ship, for what else could we do? But would the ship
stick to us? What would the ice do to the <em>Jeannette</em> during
this winter? Our memories of the horrors of the winter past
were not reassuring.</p>

<p>The month drew along. We ate our tasteless food, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
drank our distilled water, we kept ourselves alive. Two things
only broke up our unvarying daily routine—Divine Service
on Sunday, and the weekly issue (begun now for the first
time on the cruise) on Wednesday of two ounces of rum
per man. Jack Cole did not have to pipe long of a Wednesday
afternoon to get the complete roster round the whiskey
barrel. But his long piping of a Sunday morning drew no
such crowds. To Divine Service, conducted weekly in the
cabin by the captain, came not a single seaman, and of the
officers, just Chipp, Ambler, Dunbar and myself—a congregation
of four only to hear George Washington De Long,
acting chaplain, feelingly invoke the blessing of the Almighty
upon our enterprise and ask His mercy upon us—distressed,
worn mortals trapped in the Arctic wastes.</p>

<p>As October drew toward its close, distant rumblings in
the pack, cracks in the floes roundabout caused by contracting
ice, ridges of broken floe thrown up hither and yon, and
the pistol-like snappings of shrinking bolts in our timbers,
warned us of trouble. November came; we viewed its advent
with trepidation, for the previous November had inaugurated
our reign of terror. On November 6th, the sun departed
from us and the long Arctic night commenced, our
second. It would be longer this time till the sun reappeared,
ninety days or more instead of seventy-one, for we were
further north.</p>

<p>True to form, the thundering of the ice and the grinding
of the pack recommenced as per schedule in November and
the tremors coming through the thick floes shook the <em>Jeannette</em>
as in a storm. But we were more calloused. Let the pack
screech and roar! So long as nothing was happening close
aboard we merely listened. Newcomb and Collins, however,
who were more nervous than the rest, were forever running
up on deck at these shocks. They came back even more disturbed
when they could see nothing than when moving ice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
within eyesight gave the explanation.</p>

<p>November drew along without visible disaster, but the
dread and anticipation of terrors yet to come caused trouble
in other ways. Newcomb, childish always, became mum as
a clam at meals, and at other times talked to no one, except
perhaps to Collins. Whatever De Long thought of this, he
said nothing till one day passing through the taxidermy room
while Newcomb was mounting a crab, the latter stopped him,
queried,</p>

<p>“Captain, will you ask Mr. Dunbar whether he saw that
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Uria Grylle</i> he shot with his rifle yesterday, in flight?”</p>

<p>De Long, a little piqued perhaps at being thus asked by a
very junior officer to serve as a messenger boy, said,</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask him yourself, Mr. Newcomb?”</p>

<p>“Because,” replied our naturalist, “he has declined any relations
with me.”</p>

<p>De Long looked at him puzzled.</p>

<p>“Declined? On a matter of duty? That seems queer. I’ll
have to look into this.” Poking his head into the cabin outside,
he called the veteran Dunbar into the workroom, then
closed the door.</p>

<p>“What’s this, Dunbar, about your refusing to speak to Mr.
Newcomb? He’s just asked me to ask you a question about
a bird you shot, because he says you won’t speak to him.”</p>

<p>“Let him ask,” replied the ice-pilot. “I’ll speak to him
any time about anything in the line of duty. But not on other
things; I despise that little Yankee pedlar and he knows it!”</p>

<p>“Come now, Mr. Dunbar,” broke in the captain, “that’s no
way to talk about a shipmate. Don’t lay too much stress on
that little trading episode of Newcomb’s with those Indians
at St. Michael’s; Mr. Newcomb did it only as a joke.”</p>

<p>“A joke, eh?” burst out the angered whaler. “And I suppose
it’s a joke too, when he tries to write a letter home from
Siberia, criticizing his superiors, saying that you, the captain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
are a profane Catholic and Melville’s an atheist! A fine shipmate
he is!”</p>

<p>De Long, at this unexpected personal turn, reddened, grew
suddenly stern, gazed intently at Newcomb.</p>

<p>“What’s that, Mr. Newcomb? I’m a Catholic, right enough,
but I think no man can truly say I’m a profane one. Did you
write such a letter, sir?”</p>

<p>“I did not!” said Newcomb promptly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say he <em>wrote</em> one,” countered Dunbar. “I merely
said he <em>tried</em> to. There wasn’t any mail going, so I guess he
didn’t. But the little fool’s too chummy with the men; it got
out around the crew somehow that he was going to. That’s
where I heard it.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind about any scuttle butt rumors, Mr.
Dunbar. Mr. Newcomb says he didn’t write such a letter,
and that settles it. Now, Mr. Newcomb, I’ve noticed before
your not talking to your fellow officers. Forget any such
child’s play, and you’ll get along better.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I do my duty, sir?” asked Newcomb with apparent
innocence.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ll take good care that you continue to,” responded
the captain.</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” said Newcomb pertly. “If I do my duty,
I must respectfully continue the privilege of maintaining this
silence.”</p>

<p>Nonplussed at this attitude, De Long looked at the infantile
naturalist a moment, then gave up, turned on his heel
and left. Needless to say, the ice-pilot promptly did likewise,
leaving Newcomb in proud possession of his privilege
of silence.</p>

<p>But this was only a beginning of increased ill-will in the
mess, owing probably to the general state of ragged nerves.
The very next morning, Dr. Ambler and Collins had a fierce
set-to about the slamming of a door. It so happened that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
was sitting in the wardroom, calmly reading a book, when
along came Starr, the Jack-of-the-dust, to break stores out of
the afterhold. He opened the wardroom door and fastened
it back in order to roll a barrel through it, which he did.
Just then four bells struck, and it being Ambler’s turn to
get the ten o’clock observations, the doctor drew on his parka
and went out the opened door, followed soon by the huge
Russian, who, sailor fashion, kicked the door to as he passed.
The door closed with a bang, startling Collins, who as usual
was asleep during the morning. Collins, grabbing a few
clothes, shot by me out of his room, mad as a hornet. He
never noticed Starr who was still busy rolling his barrel forward,
but spotting the doctor on his way up to the deck
above, raced after him, seized him by the arm, and belligerently
demanded,</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean by slamming the door like that? You
know well enough I always sleep in the morning!”</p>

<p>Ambler looked at him in complete mystification.</p>

<p>“Why, what are you talking about, Mr. Collins? I haven’t
closed any doors, let alone slammed them.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye think woke me up then? I’m not crazy! I
heard you do it, and I’m damned sick of my being broken
out of my sleep by you or by anybody!”</p>

<p>A dangerous hardness came into Dr. Ambler’s usually soft
Virginian voice.</p>

<p>“I tell you I didn’t slam any door! Mr. Collins, do you
mean to say to me that I lie?”</p>

<p>What might have happened, I don’t know. I scrambled up
the ladder, thrust myself between the two. From the glint in
Ambler’s eyes, it looked to me like bloodshed next.</p>

<p>“Hold on, gentlemen! Please!” I begged. “I know all about
this. The Jack-of-the-dust slammed that door; Dr. Ambler
didn’t even notice it. Now look here, Collins! If you’d been
faster on your feet, you’d have seen who did it yourself;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
and if you weren’t so damned fast at taking offense at every
little thing, you’d have rolled over and gone to sleep again
without bothering about a little noise. Now apologize to the
doctor and turn in again till you’ve slept off that grouch!”</p>

<p>Collins, very red in the face at having made a fool of himself,
mumbled out some lame apology, which Ambler accepted
without comment and departed to take the morning
observations. I went below to continue my interrupted reading,
but Collins, instead of turning in, moped about all day,
no doubt trying to justify to himself his ridiculous conduct;
very possibly wondering also whether I had not fabricated
from the whole cloth that yarn about the Jack-of-the-dust to
put him in a hole and figuring how he might reciprocate.</p>

<p>At any rate, at dinner that evening, he startled me by
breaking his usual mealtime reticence and remarking as I was
hacking away at the salt beef,</p>

<p>“There’s old Melville, getting gray and bald over his confinement
in the ice.”</p>

<p>“No, Collins,” I shot back, “my hair’s no grayer than
yours. And as for my baldness, I’ve suffered neither heat nor
cold from it since I’ve been in the Arctic, but I will admit
that if instead of being marooned here, we were off Saint
Patrick’s Land where we could all be hunting now, probably
I’d have a better time.”</p>

<p>“So?” said Collins, instantly offended. “That settles it!
When a man starts to get personal in his remarks, I don’t have
anything more to say.”</p>

<p>“Personal? Who’s getting personal?” I asked, perplexed, for
if Collins’ commenting on my baldness was not personal,
what was? Then recalling my statement, I blushed myself, for
in my haste in getting in my repartee I realized suddenly
that my tongue had slipped. “Did I say <em>Saint</em> Patrick’s Land,
Collins? I’m sorry; I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. I
meant <em>Prince</em> Patrick’s Land, off to the northeast of here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, Melville; I’m not a fool!” Collins blazed out, obviously
certain now that I was altogether too facile in explaining
away embarrassing situations. “When you said Saint
Patrick’s Land, you meant Saint Patrick’s Land! And as for
my gray hairs, I got them in honorable service you’re completely
ignorant of!”</p>

<p>Well, I thought to myself, where does he think I got mine?
Surely the Civil War, which started me off on both my grayness
and my baldness, was honorable service! But very prudently,
I kept my thoughts to myself and my mouth shut.
What was the use of further inflaming him? Quietly I bent
my beard over my plate and resumed operations on my salt
beef, while the rest of the mess, content to let the matter
drop, wisely did the same and the meal closed in a tenser
silence even than it had opened.</p>

<p>It began to seem now as if every little thing caused trouble.
That night I had a remarkable dream, and there being so
little to talk about that all hands had not heard discussed a
hundred times over, I sprang it on the mess after breakfast,
expecting to get a good laugh out of them.</p>

<p>“Say, mates,” I began, “speaking of all the instruments we
have to read on our meteorological observations, I had a
grand dream about ’em last night. Want to hear it?”</p>

<p>“Guaranteed a brand-new dream, chief?” demanded Chipp.
“If not, belay the story, for I dream about instruments every
night now myself.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mind Chipp, chief. Shoot it!” encouraged the blindfolded
Danenhower from the foot of the table. “I can stand
it, anyway; I don’t have to read those instruments any more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s new all right,” I assured Chipp. “Stand by then.
I dreamed last night I was old Professor Louis Agassiz himself,
king of the scientific world, and without a stitch of
clothes on, I was going down the middle of Pennsylvania
Avenue on my way to the Smithsonian Institution, decked out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
with necklaces of hygrometers, bracelets made of thermometers,
a belt like a South Sea hula-hula’s grass skirt made up
of mercurial barometers, and God knows what other instruments
dangling from my fingers and my toes. And there I
was, dancing along through the heart of Washington with
all those instruments on me clattering like castanets, offering
to sell ’em to the crowd at only two cents apiece, but
nobody would buy!”</p>

<p>Amid a gale of laughter from my messmates, I danced
around my chair snapping my fingers, illustrating, then asked,</p>

<p>“Now, how’s that for a dream, boys?”</p>

<p>“I think it’s damned insulting to me and my profession, if
you want my opinion!” broke in an unexpected voice.</p>

<p>Taken completely aback, I stopped dead in my dance and
whirled about. There standing in his stateroom door, watching
me, was Collins, who, never on hand for breakfast, was
at that time normally sound asleep. A dead silence fell on the
laughing mess.</p>

<p>“And if you’ve got to try to make me look like a damned
fool, Melville, with your jokes about nakedness and that my
instruments are not worth two cents, wait till I’m off the
ship!”</p>

<p>Slam! went the door, closing off our meteorologist, whom
I had never even thought of in connection with my dream,
from my sight. I sank back into my chair with a deep sigh.
I couldn’t even relate an innocent dream without offending
the touchy Collins.</p>

<p>However, that was not the end of it, though I had hoped
it was. The day itself wore along like all our other days, an
utter blank, till about ten p.m., when with all hands about
ready to turn in, the captain in his cabin sent for Collins, and
as luck would have it, asked him, of all things, to bring a
thermometer!</p>

<p>Collins went to fetch the thermometer, some special one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
and took it into the cabin. There was some conversation
about thermometers which, the skipper’s door being open,
was faintly audible to us in the wardroom, but to which I
paid little attention, till, the subject of thermometers evidently
being now a raw one with Collins, I heard him say in
a loud voice,</p>

<p>“Captain, I wish the officers would treat me with the same
courtesy I try to treat them.”</p>

<p>At that I pricked up my ears.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” demanded De Long
quickly. “If you have any particular charge to make against
any officer, make it right now and I’ll investigate it.”</p>

<p>That was the last I heard, for the captain immediately
closed his door, wanting privacy of course for such a discussion.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s where I have to explain even my dreams,”
I thought to myself as I rolled into my bunk. “What a life!”
Still, I managed to sleep that night with no more nightmares
about thermometers to disturb me, and I woke in the morning
quite refreshed. Nothing happened during breakfast either,
and I was beginning to think that perhaps Collins was more
of a man after all than the night before I had given him credit
for being, when a little after eleven, while out on the ice for
my regulation exercise, De Long hailed me,</p>

<p>“Come here, Melville. I want to see you.”</p>

<p>I went over. It was forty below zero, and, I thought, a
devil of a temperature in which to get hauled up over thermometers.</p>

<p>“Last night, chief,” said the captain, starting mildly enough,
“in a conversation with Mr. Collins, he reported you to me
for plaguing him. I asked him what the trouble was, and he
said that you were always cracking jokes and singing Irish
songs to make game of him.”</p>

<p>“What?” I mumbled half to myself, completely flabbergasted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
“Songs, in addition to thermometers?”</p>

<p>But the captain, oblivious of my interruption, finished decisively,</p>

<p>“Melville, you had better not sing any more.”</p>

<p>“Why, captain!” I said in astonishment. “I don’t think I
should be muzzled in this manner. There’s no reason why I
shouldn’t sing a song if I want to. It’s my only relaxation.
My songs don’t disturb anybody.”</p>

<p>“Collins says your Irish songs disturb him. Sing something
else,” ordered the captain flatly.</p>

<p>“But, captain, I can’t. I don’t know any other songs.”</p>

<p>“Well, sing psalms then.”</p>

<p>“Psalms? Me?” I protested. “Never! I didn’t ship as a psalm
singer!”</p>

<p>“Very well, chief; suit yourself,” said the skipper with a
note of finality in his voice. “It’s a little cold out here to discuss
the matter further. You had better stop singing altogether
then,” and leaving me badly upset at the idea of losing
my one diversion, he walked off in the snow, resuming his
exercise.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, I looked around the frosty field of ice
to starboard of the <em>Jeannette</em>, which constituted our exercise
grounds, for the cause of that muzzle the captain so unceremoniously
had just slapped on me. A little way off was Collins,
undoubtedly a witness to what had gone on, and in view
of the extraordinary way sounds carried across the ice in
that Arctic air, probably a willing enough auditor also. I
strode over to him.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Collins.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Melville.”</p>

<p>I was too hot in one way and too cold in another for any
preliminaries. I jumped headfirst into my subject.</p>

<p>“The captain tells me you complained to him and claimed
his protection against my jokes and my singing Irish songs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
and making game of you. Collins, that was neither upright
nor manly!”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” said Collins. “I’ll explain that thing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any explanations! It’s plain enough what
you’ve done. If you’d come to me like any shipmate should,
and told me that my jokes and songs were disagreeable to you,
I wouldn’t have sung another song or cracked another joke.
But your tale-bearing makes me sick! From now on, we’re
through! You keep to your side of the ship and I’ll keep to
mine! And don’t you forget it!”</p>

<p>And from that day forward, I never spoke again to Collins
nor he to me, except when I was told to carry him an
order.</p>

<p>Our wardroom mess was now in a fine state for sociability.
Danenhower, blinded, behind the bulkhead of his stateroom
talked almost incessantly to relieve his monotony but nobody
paid any attention to that as conversation. Dunbar wouldn’t
talk to Newcomb; Collins and I were not on speaking terms;
Newcomb would not talk to anybody; Collins was nearly
as bad, speaking pleasantly only to Danenhower; Chipp was
naturally reticent and had little to say ever; Dunbar, much
aged by illness, was taciturn as a result; the captain, weighted
down by his responsibilities, felt compelled to maintain an
extreme official reserve; and only Dr. Ambler and I were
left ever to carry on a conversation like ordinary human
beings. The ice was working on us, all right. A casual visitor,
had one been able to poke his head through our door on the
<em>Jeannette</em> at any meal, would have concluded that we were
about to attend the funeral of some dear friend, and in that
he would not have been far wrong; subconsciously we felt
and acted as if we were going to a funeral, only it was—ours!</p>

<p>Matters in one direction at least soon came to a head with
a rush. Collins, usually the last man out on the ice at eleven
a.m. for exercise and the first man aboard at one p.m., when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
it ended, now began to comply with the exercise order even
less cheerfully. As a regular thing he was considerably late
in leaving the ship, and what was worse, he took an ungodly
length of time, when he went aboard at noon to record the
results of his midday observations in the log, to get back again
on the ice with the rest of us. This quickly became such a
flagrant flouting of the exercise order that while no one said
anything about it, De Long could hardly overlook it and keep
his authority with the rest of us. December 2nd brought
the end.</p>

<p>Collins, late on the ice that day as usual, went promptly
aboard at eight bells to log the readings. When he failed to
reappear after about three times the period required to note
them down, De Long with an irritated look on his face
boarded the ship. He glanced through the door, always open
for ventilation purposes while the ship was cleared, into the
cabin. There with his parka off, smoking his pipe, was Collins,
leisurely writing in the logbook and carrying on an
animated conversation through the opened doors and hatches
with Danenhower in his stateroom on the deck below. De
Long, further irritated at this confirmation of his suspicions,
said nothing and returned to the ice, pacing nervously back
and forth for another period long enough for anyone again
to have logged the readings thrice over, and still no Collins!
De Long reached the end of his patience. With determination
in his stride, up the gangway went the captain and into
the cabin. What happened afterwards, I got from Danenhower,
who, an unwilling listener (unless he plugged his
ears), was forced to take it all in.</p>

<p>Collins, at the stove drawing on his gloves, was still talking
with Danenhower, when he looked up in surprise to find
the skipper regarding him fixedly. De Long opened the ball.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Collins, has it required all this time for you to
record the 12 o’clock observations?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>Collins, a little nettled, replied,</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I hardly know the meaning of your question.”</p>

<p>At this naive disclaimer of comprehending simple English,
De Long proceeded to explain in words of one syllable,</p>

<p>“The meaning of my question, sir, is this: Is it necessary
for you, in order to record the 12 o’clock observations, to
remove your coat, light your pipe, engage in a conversation
with Mr. Danenhower, and remain in the cabin for twenty
minutes when you should be exercising?”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Collins curtly, “perhaps I might have
done it quicker, but I didn’t know my minutes were being
counted for me.”</p>

<p>With difficulty swallowing the broad implication of spying
contained in Collins’ last words, the captain said evenly,</p>

<p>“I have seen fit to issue an order that everybody should go
on the ice from 11 to 1, and your coming in the cabin and
remaining for twenty minutes is a violation I will neither submit
to nor permit you to continue. I have noticed for several
days that you were longer than necessary in logging the noon
observations, and today I satisfied myself on the subject.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” said Collins contemptuously, “if you are
satisfied, of course I have nothing more to say. But you are
doing me a great injustice!”</p>

<p>That was too much for De Long, who as captain prided
himself on even-handed justice for all hands. Whatever his
ideas were before, he now changed his mind.</p>

<p>“Mr. Collins, as I have recently shown you, a representation
to me of injustice has only to be made in proper language
to secure you all the justice you want. But I do not
like your manner or bearing in talking with me. You seem
to assume that you are to receive no correction, direction,
or dictation from me; that your view of an occurrence is
always to be taken; and that if I differ from you, it is my
misfortune, but of no importance to the result!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>At this Collins blazed up.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t like the manner you speak to me either,
nor the way in which I am taken to task!”</p>

<p>De Long looked calmly at him.</p>

<p>“I am your commanding officer, Mr. Collins. I have a perfect
right to say what I say to you.”</p>

<p>But this Collins would evidently not admit. In a fiery tone,
he shot back,</p>

<p>“I acknowledge only the rights given you by Naval Regulations!”</p>

<p>That shot rocked De Long and he promptly flared up.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to imply that I am going contrary to Naval
Regulations?” he asked, outraged.</p>

<p>“I mean to say,” said Collins flatly, “that you have no right
to talk to me as you do!”</p>

<p>De Long considered that carefully before speaking, then
in as official a voice as he could still muster he stated,</p>

<p>“I consider that by coming into the cabin as you did today,
removing your coat, lighting your pipe, and carrying on a
conversation with Mr. Danenhower, you took advantage of
the 12 o’clock observation to disregard my order in relation
to the exercise.”</p>

<p>“And when you say that,” roared Collins, “I say it is <em>not</em>
so!”</p>

<p>Amazed now by this open insubordination, De Long
paused and regarded the belligerent Collins with perplexity,
puzzled by a situation so complicated that the like of it no
commanding officer in naval history had ever had to deal
with. The captain finally decided to try to calm Collins down,
educating him a bit in naval manners, before finally admonishing
him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Collins, great allowance has been made for your ignorance
of Naval Regulations, your position in this ship, and
your being so situated the first time. But you must remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
that the commanding officer is to be spoken to in a
respectful manner and with respectful language, and you do
not seem to attend to either particular.”</p>

<p>Collins rudely tossed this olive branch into the scuppers, so
to speak, by retorting truculently,</p>

<p>“I treat the commanding officer of this ship with all the
respect due him as head of the expedition, but when he
charges me with violating an order, I say, <span class="allsmcap">I HAVE NOT</span>!”</p>

<p>De Long accepted the challenge.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose you will be permitted to contradict me
flatly in that way, sir? Have you lost your senses?”</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed Collins. “<em>I</em> haven’t lost my senses. I know
what I say. And when you say I’ve violated an order, I say
I have <em>not</em>!”</p>

<p>For the long-suffering De Long, that settled it. He rose,
a dangerous coldness in his voice.</p>

<p>“Enough, Mr. Collins! You can’t be properly dealt with
in this ice. When we get back to the United States, I’ll have
you courtmartialed! Meanwhile, turn in all your instruments,
and perform no further duty on this ship. You’re under
arrest!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">December was notable mainly for continued low temperatures,
down around -50° F. We thankfully saw it slip away
with nothing to remember it by save a minstrel show given
by the crew to mark our second Christmas Eve in the ice.
That this show was in any way memorable was mainly owing
to my coalheaver, comical little Sharvell, who rigged himself
out as an attractive English miss in a sailor-made calico
dress, a blond wig (originally the fibers of a manila hawser),
white stockings, and low shoes. He provided so fair and
alluring an imitation of something no sailor on the <em>Jeannette</em>
had for a year and a half been within hail of, that the show
was immediately a howling success, hardly needing the double
ration of rum served out beforehand to make the audience
not too critical of the performance.</p>

<p>Of Christmas Day itself, the less said the better. Our mince
pies were made of pemmican this time, the canned mince meat
having been all used up our first year’s holiday. In spite of
the brandy flavoring, there was probably not one of us who
was not wondering with gloomy foreboding as he bit into
his pemmican pie what, if anything, that crafty Chinaman,
Ah Sam, would have left to substitute for the mince meat for
our third Christmas in the pack.</p>

<p>And soon another New Year’s Eve, with more minstrels;
a little more rum; a fine speech to the crew by the captain
ending with the cheerily-expressed hope that before another
New Year’s Eve, we would all be back in our homes, saying
to our friends with pardonable pride,</p>

<p>“I, too, was a member of the <em>Jeannette</em> Expedition.”</p>

<p>The only trouble with the speech was that no one, including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
the captain himself, in his heart really believed it. Then
came midnight, with eight bells for the old year, eight bells
more for the new one; and we soberly faced the year 1881.
1879 and 1880 had been heartbreakers for us. What had
1881 in store for the <em>Jeannette</em>, there in the Arctic?</p>

<p>To start with, it had January gales, bitter cold, and the
usual thunderous uproar of the pack in motion, but fortunately
never close enough to endanger us. And wonder of
wonders, the discovery that the gales were mostly easterly,
so that both by observation and by drift lead, we found that
at last we were going (when we went at all) steadily in one
direction, northwest, and no longer endlessly zigzagging to
and fro like a <em>Flying Dutchman</em> to the northward of Wrangel
Land. And to lend a little further zest to this pleasing state
of affairs, the month of January closed with the ship in latitude
74° 41′ N., longitude 173° 10′ E., a little farther west
and three miles farther north than any of our previous
peregrinations with the pack had ever got us. We began to
take notice. Perhaps we were at last “going somewhere,” although
since the pack was moving with us, our scenery was
changing not the slightest.</p>

<p>February arrived, and with it on February 5 came the SUN—a
glorious sight to us after ninety-one long days of night!
And never was he hailed by sun worshipers in ancient Persian
temples with such sincere joy and enthusiasm as by the
sadly bleached and frozen array of careworn, fur-clad seamen
on the <em>Jeannette</em>. We streamed out on the ice with the
temperature at 40° below zero to bask in the light, real daylight!
of part of the sun’s disk peeping over the horizon at
us at noon. We thanked God for the sun’s return, bringing
to us once more the light to shine on our ship, still pumping
away at our leak but no more damaged than when he left us
in early November.</p>

<p>The rest of February and all of March went by with no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
signs of letup in our winter cold. A few more gales, seemingly
worse than ever, buried the ship in fine snow, leaving
only the three masts sticking up out of the white wastes to
mark our position, but the winds continued easterly and we
continued our northwest drift with our soundings steadily
increasing also. Were we at last getting off the Siberian continental
shelf into the deeper water of the open Arctic Sea?
We hoped so, for deeper water meant greater opportunity
for the ocean to break up the pack.</p>

<p>We drifted across the 75th parallel of latitude, for us a
red letter event. 75° North! It sounded much better. While
not to be compared with the 83° North already attained along
the Greenland coasts by other explorers, still it looked promising,
and what a change from forever shuttling back and
forth between parallels 72° and 74° for twenty weary
months!</p>

<p>In other ways, matters in March were worse. Several times,
from the screeching of the pack, the cracking of the ice,
and the severe shocks to the ship, we feared we were in for
a repetition of some of our hair-raising experiences of the
first winter, but each time the tumbling floes failed to come
near us, and we thankfully heard the distant roarings subside.
On top of that, the doctor, who all through the year
had hopefully lanced and probed the abscess in Danenhower’s
left eye, found himself searching his soul as to whether he
should undertake a major operation, but finally in view of
all conditions, concluded he dared not. Dan, wan and emaciated
from his long confinement, could at least see with one
eye, his right, and that eye while weak from sympathetic
suffering with its mate, seemed now in less danger of becoming
permanently affected. As a result, Dan with his left
eye blindfolded and his right heavily shielded by a colored
lens, was occasionally allowed to walk over the ship, and
even, when the weather was unusually favorable, permitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
to grope his way round the ice alongside.</p>

<p>Aside from these matters, March brought us two other
unusual episodes to break the monotony of our lives. The
first was a bear, a she-bear as it turned out and recently a
mother, which facts may have explained matters, for this bear,
cornered by the dogs on top of a hummock near the ship,
put up such a tremendous fight as we never saw before. The
top of that hummock was a mass of flying fur and snarling
dogs, the heavens resounding with howls, screeches, and
roars, dogs leaping in to attack only to be sent sailing right
and left on their backs. Bear and dogs were out for a finish
fight—savage teeth and lunging claws made a shambles of the
ice on that hummock—how it might have ended was a question,
for finally Nindemann, coming up, settled the battle
with his rifle.</p>

<p>For us she turned out to be a very expensive bear; when
we took stock of casualties, we found one dog, Plug Ugly,
dead; another, Prince, ripped open from back to shoulder;
three more, Wolf, Tom, and Bingo, with gashed sides and
stomachs; while Snoozer (the captain’s favorite) had his
mouth considerably lengthened as by a razor, and Smike was
badly chewed in two places, not to mention half a dozen
other dogs licking minor injuries. Dr. Ambler put in a busy
day with thread and needle sewing up the wounded. When
it was all over, we had a badly battered pack of dogs who
were quite agreeable to crawling quietly off into the snow,
by unanimous consent suspending all hostilities among themselves.</p>

<p>The other deviation from monotony was the sudden interest
taken by our two Chinamen, Tong Sing and Ah Sam,
in flying kites. The steady and continuous east winds no
doubt brought to mind their opportunity, and soon Chinese
kites in all shapes, fashions, and colors—birds, flies, and
dragons—were fluttering in the breeze as tranquilly as if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
were on the green banks of the Yang-Tse-Kiang, instead of
in the Arctic ice at 40° below. The antics of our cook and
steward with their playthings kept the crew, lining the <em>Jeannette’s</em>
rail watching them, in an uproar. But so seriously did
Sing and Sam take their pastime that when imperative routine
sent them back to cabin and galley, instead of winding in
their lines, they would tie their kite-strings to whatever was
handiest on the lee side, the shrouds, the davits, or the belaying
pins, till they could emerge again and cast loose; and
the captain believed that had it been necessary, they would
cheerfully have torn up their shirts for kite-tails!</p>

<p>April 1 came, bringing with it by the calendar our spring
and summer routine, but no particular break in the weather,
which on April 16 was still -26° F., much worse than comparable
temperatures of the year before; for us, certainly not
a hopeful sign.</p>

<p>We soon had another bit of excitement; a few days later
for a while we feared that we had lost our entire commissary
department. Both Ah Sam and Tong Sing, armed with
rifles, in the early afternoon went off hunting on the pack.
When by seven at night they had not returned, we became
not only hungry but alarmed, and sent out a searching party.
At nine o’clock, they met the steward, Charley Tong Sing,
coming in alone, to tell a very involved story. A few miles
from the ship, as he related it, he and the cook had picked up
a bear track and with visions of more fresh bear to work on
for dinner, they started eagerly in pursuit, after some miles
coming in sight of the bear, which to their joy they found
was being worried along by two of our best dogs, Wolf and
Prince.</p>

<p>The dogs seeing reenforcements at last coming up in the
form of our two Chinamen, and all hunters looking alike
to them, promptly brought the bear to a stand by heading him
off and snapping at his nose.</p>

<p>Running forward to get in a shot, Charley unfortunately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
slipped amongst some broken ice, and a piece of it fell on
his back, holding him down, or he positively asserted, he
would have killed the bear. Thus <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>, he lay while
the dogs, no doubt thoroughly disgusted at such inexpert
support, let the bear get underway again. By the time Ah
Sam had managed to pry the ice off Charley and release him,
neither bear nor dogs was in sight.</p>

<p>It being now at least six o’clock, both cook and steward
came suddenly to the realization that aboard ship, chow was
way past due and held a council of war, the upshot of which
was that the cook as senior officer present, ordered the
steward to return to both cook and serve dinner while he,
the cook, kept on to bag the bear. So there, safely back, was
Charley Tong Sing, but where was our cook and where were
our two best dogs?</p>

<p>De Long, having finally digested (instead of his dinner)
this story in excited pidgin English of ice, bears, dogs, and
Chinamen, looked at his executive officer in dismay. It was
now dark, with considerable wind and drifting snow.</p>

<p>“Shall I send the searching party out again, sir?” asked
Chipp.</p>

<p>“What the use?” queried the harassed skipper. “A bear
chased by dogs chased by a cook is too pressed for time to
steer a proper compass course, so where should we look?”</p>

<p>We waited and worried till midnight, when that fear at
least was allayed as Ah Sam, thoroughly exhausted, came
stumbling up the gangway, and a more completely demoralized
Chinaman you could never find. De Long personally
made him drink half a tumblerful of whiskey to bring him
round, but he was completely incoherent and began to cry.
When at last he was calmed a little, he related how he had
continued to chase the bear, which the two dogs to give him
a chance, by fierce attacks managed occasionally to stop for
a minute or two but never for long enough for him to get
within range. The dogs, Prince and Wolf, fighting desperately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
this way as the bear retreated, were both bleeding. Ah
Sam says he followed the bear on a southerly course fifteen
miles, determined to get him if he had to chase him all the way
to China. Then by a particularly vicious onslaught, the dogs
finally succeeded in holding the bear till Ah Sam could run
up close enough for a fine shot. Raising his rifle, our cook
took careful aim on the bear’s head, and pressed the trigger,
when horror of horrors, instead of hurting the bear, the rifle
exploded in his hands! His morale completely shattered, poor
Ah Sam sat down in the snow and wept, while the bear, still
accompanied by Wolf and Prince, amazed no doubt by such
weird hunting, but unwilling to give up, moved on over the
pack and that was the last he saw of any of them. Still weeping,
Ah Sam picked up the remains of his rifle and started
home. How he ever found the ship again, he didn’t know;
it had taken him, walking continuously, until midnight. And
there, indicating it with a hysterical wave of his hand, as
proof of this wild story was the treacherous rifle!</p>

<p>We examined it curiously. Ah Sam had not exaggerated—the
gun barrel was torn to pieces; only a half length, cracked
open, being left still attached to the stock. But to anyone used
to firearms, the answer was simple. Ah Sam, in his long chase,
must have let the muzzle slip into a snowdrift; the snow
freezing solidly in the bore, had plugged it off, with the
natural result that when he fired, there being no proper release
for the exploding powder, it had promptly blown off
the muzzle.</p>

<p>Dr. Ambler examined Ah Sam carefully for wounds; it
seemed a miracle one of those flying rifle fragments had not
cut his head off. But physically he had escaped unscathed;
his demoralization was wholly mental, owing to the way, in
his efforts to provide roast bear for dinner, an unkind fate
had treated him. Still weeping, poor Ah Sam was led off to
his bunk.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">April drew toward its close, leaving us as a parting gift in
latitude 76° 19′ N., longitude 164° 45′ E. Over 76° North,
and with our drift increasing in speed weekly! We were on
our way now with a vengeance, moving at last toward the
Pole. A few more months like April, and we might find ourselves
by the middle of summer across the 83rd parallel, to
establish with the <em>Jeannette</em> at the very least a new record for
Farthest North! The effect on George Washington De Long
was magical—his shoulders straightened up as if he had shed
a heavy weight, his blue eyes became positively cheery, new
courage oozed from his every gesture—after twenty weary
months of discouragement and defeat, our third year in the
Arctic was going to redeem all and send us home unashamed!</p>

<p>May came. The temperature rose only a little, reaching
zero, but we didn’t mind that much, for in a few days we
were nearing the 77th parallel. The captain’s cheerfulness
began to communicate itself to the crew and a livelier spirit
became decidedly manifest in all hands, with one exception,
that is. Collins, of course, was the exception. He, technically
a prisoner awaiting courtmartial, moped worse than ever;
upset even more by the idea that now that he no longer had
any active part, the expedition might really accomplish something.
Physically Collins was not under restraint—no irons,
no cell, not even restriction to his own stateroom, let alone
restriction to the confines of the ship. The captain had no
wish to risk Collins’ health by even such confinement as
Danenhower was involuntarily subjected to. But relieved
wholly of all duty and responsibility, Collins was in effect
merely a passenger; his former work was divided between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
the captain, Ambler, Chipp and myself, throwing a heavier
load on us, for the meteorological observations were religiously
kept up. Indeed, with the ship at last rapidly changing
position northward and westward, they were now increased.
Still a member of the cabin mess, Collins ate with
us, absolutely silent except for an ostentatiously polite “Good
morning, captain,” once a day, after which his fine oblivion
respecting the existence of the rest of us was an excellent wet
blanket on conviviality at meals.</p>

<p>But other things relieved the monotony of meals a bit.
Ducks and geese began to show up overhead, flying some
west, some north, and occasionally landing on the small
pools near by, formed by the continually changing cracks
in the moving ice. Dunbar and Alexey knocked down some
with their shotguns. After our continuous diet of salt beef
and insipid canned meat, rest assured we bit into those heaven-sent
ducks avidly, though frequently sudden cries of pain
as some <em>gourmet’s</em> teeth came down hard on pellets of lead,
showed that Ah Sam had been none too careful in extracting
birdshot before serving.</p>

<p>The weather warmed up a bit. The sun, though never high
in the heavens, stayed above the horizon twenty-four hours
a day, and even at midnight we began to see him, paradoxically
enough, looking at us from due north, over the unknown
Pole!</p>

<p>But as another paradox, now that winter was going and
late spring and continuous daylight were with us, the doctor
for the first time on our long cruise since the diarrhoea epidemic
in 1879, began again to have a string of patients. Chipp,
Tong Sing, Newcomb, Alexey, Kuehne, Nindemann, and
unfortunately, himself—all complained of general debility,
cramps in varying degrees, and slight indications of palsy.
Chipp, Tong Sing, and Newcomb, in the order named, were
worst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>What was the trouble? The doctor, himself a minor sufferer,
was able to work on his own symptoms as well as on
those of the others in diagnosis. Naturally, since we had just
come through the winter, scurvy was promptly suspected,
but not a single evidence of the very obvious manifestations
of that disease could the doctor find in anyone. This was
some mental relief, for in the midst of all our other failures,
De Long, Ambler, and I had taken considerable pride in
having with my distilled water kept us free of that Arctic
scourge and for a longer period than ever before in history.</p>

<p>But if it wasn’t scurvy, what was it? Ambler racked his
brains and his medical books, going over all possible diseases
that cold, exposure, darkness, poor ventilation, depression,
and our diet might have exposed us to, but to no result.
The symptoms were none too obvious; he could lay his finger
on nothing definite. Had we developed a new Arctic disease
from our unprecedented stay in the ice? The surgeon could
not say—only time would tell. Meanwhile, Chipp, the worst
sufferer, decidedly thin and weak, was first relieved of part
of his duties and then of all of them. The other victims were
told to take things easier till they had recuperated.</p>

<p>But as the days dragged along, they didn’t recuperate, they
got worse. The doctor put Chipp on the sicklist and ordered
him to bed; the same with Charley Tong Sing whose case
became even more serious. Meanwhile Ambler, suffering
himself, was feverishly searching his <cite>Materia Medica</cite> for an
antidote. But with no definite diagnosis of the disease possible,
his search was fruitless. Ambler was nearly distracted,
for no ailment arising from our manner of life fitted in with
the vague symptoms. And then a severe attack of colic in
Newcomb gave him a clue. He checked his medical books,
checked the other patients, and with a grave face went to the
captain to inform him that, implausible as it seemed, without
question every man on the sicklist was suffering from acute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
lead poisoning!</p>

<p>That made the mystery even deeper. If lead poisoning,
where was the lead coming from? Lead poisoning was normally
a painter’s disease and not for months had any man
on the ship touched a paint pot or a brush. What then was
the source? As the most probable cause, I had to direct suspicion
at myself, for Bartlett, Lee, and I in making up our
distiller piping joints, had for tightness wiped them all with
red lead. Immediately, Surgeon Ambler who had daily for
a year and a half been testing the water for salt, tested it for
lead. He found some insignificant traces, but it seemed hard
to believe such minute quantities could cause us trouble. Still
we had been imbibing that water constantly and the cumulative
effect might have done it. While the problem of dismantling
all the pipe joints and cleaning them of red lead
was being cogitated, the captain went one step further—he
ordered Ah Sam to discontinue for use in making tea and
coffee, the pots which had soldered joints, and to replace
them with iron vessels.</p>

<p>And so, all full of this lugubrious discovery as to what
had laid up our shipmates, we met for dinner, a much reduced
mess, with only De Long, Dunbar, Danenhower, Collins and
myself present. Ah Sam, substituting for the deathly ill Tong
Sing, served the meal—no bear, no seal, no ducks this time—just
salt beef and the ever present stewed tomatoes, our principal
vegetable antidote for scurvy, the supply of which was
holding out splendidly.</p>

<p>More quietly even than usual, dinner proceeded. I carved
the salt beef, Dunbar ladled out the tomatoes. Ah Sam padded
around the cabin with the dishes. Moodily we bent over
our plates, and then an outburst, doubly noticeable in that
silence, brought us erect.</p>

<p>“Bah!” burst out the semi-blinded Danenhower, spitting
out a mouthful of food. “I don’t mind breaking my teeth on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
duck, but who, for God’s sake, shot these tomatoes?”</p>

<p>“Shot the tomatoes, Dan? What do you mean?” asked the
puzzled skipper.</p>

<p>“Just what I say,” mumbled Dan, trying more delicately
with his napkin now to rid his mouth of the remainder.
“They’re full of birdshot!”</p>

<p>I walked over and examined the tomatoes spattered on the
tablecloth before Danenhower. Sure enough, there in the
reddish mess were several black pellets of solder, looking
remarkably like birdshot! A light dawned on me.</p>

<p>“Ah Sam!” I ordered, “bring me right away, half a dozen
unopened cans of tomatoes and a can opener, savvy?”</p>

<p>“I savvy; light away I bling cans from galley,” answered
the cook, and in a few minutes dinner was suspended and
forgotten, while the mess table was converted into a workbench
on which I opened cans and poured the contents into
a large tureen. In every can we found drops of solder, mostly
tiny! Evidently when the canned tomatoes were stewed before
being served, the hot acid juices of the cooking tomatoes
completely dissolved the fine lead pellets. They had never
been noticed till a few drops large enough to escape complete
solution had come through for Dan to bite on!</p>

<p>We called the sick doctor from his bunk. He promptly
got his chemicals and then and there tested the hot stewed
tomatoes already served for dinner. The percentage of lead
in them was far above anything found in our water. No
question about it now, the tomatoes were the cause—our mysterious
lead poisoning was at last solved!</p>

<p>But the captain was still both perplexed and worried.
Perplexed, because from the day we entered the ice, we had
had canned tomatoes four times a week. Why hadn’t we been
poisoned before and why were some of us apparently still
unaffected? He was worried, because if we gave up tomatoes,
our last source of anything like vegetables, what (with our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
lime-juice now practically gone) over the long months to
come was going to save us from scurvy?</p>

<p>Dr. Ambler quickly resolved both difficulties by pointing
out that as for the perplexity, till May came, we had had
tomatoes but four times a week while since then we had had
them daily, thus practically doubling the lead dosage and
nearly as promptly starting the trouble. As for the reason
why some were victims and some not—of the bad cases,
Chipp, weak already from overwork and in poor condition,
was a natural victim; Newcomb, little resistant to anything,
another; as for himself and the bluejackets who were a little
less affected, they were just somewhat more susceptible than
some of the rest of us, but in a short time the lead would
have got us all. Tong Sing’s case, worse than anybody’s, he
had to confess he couldn’t explain, but Ah Sam could and
quickly did make it crystal clear,</p>

<p>“Cholly Tong Sing, he likee tomato! He eat plenty, allee
same bleakfast, dinner, supper!”</p>

<p>All we need do to prevent scurvy was go back to the issue
of tomatoes only four times a week, which quantity of lead
absorption we had before apparently withstood. In addition
we tried to reduce the lead still further by having Ah Sam
carefully strain out and remove all pellets of solder <em>before</em>
cooking, thus keeping the lead content down to the minimum,
that is, whatever the cold tomatoes had already dissolved.</p>

<p>So with Ah Sam clearing away the mess of emptied cans,
we went back to finish our dinner, lukewarm salt beef only
now; silent again, wondering, if we had to stay in the Arctic
another year, whether it was preferable to eschew the tomatoes
and die of scurvy or to continue eating them and pass
away of chronic lead poisoning.</p>

<p>The day dragged along. We were in the middle of May,
it being the 16th. Our rapid drift continued through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
afternoon, more westerly than northerly, but either was perfectly
all right with us. The ice was “livelier,” cracks and
water leads showed up more frequently, the ship was often
jolted by submerged masses of ice, and not so far away as
earlier in the spring, high ridges of broken floes were piling
up all around us. Then in the early evening after supper,
from Mr. Dunbar who more out of habit than hope had
crawled up to the crow’s-nest for a look around, came
the cry,</p>

<p>“LAND!”</p>

<p>And sure enough, there was land! Off to the westward lay
an unknown island!</p>

<p>The crew of the <em>Jeannette</em> was delirious with excitement.
Instead of ice, there was <em>land</em> to look at, something we had
dully begun to assume had somehow ceased to exist on this
globe. And we had discovered it! In exploration, our voyage
was no longer a blank! In honor of that, Captain De Long
immediately ordered served out to all hands a double ration
of rum.</p>

<p>Not since March, 1880, when Wrangel Land last disappeared
from sight, had we seen land. As yet we could not
see much of this island, nor even make out its distance, but
somewhere between thirty and seventy miles off it stood, in
black and white against the sky and the ice, masked a little
by fog over part of it. But our imaginations ran riot over
<em>our</em> island! That must have been the land toward which the
ducks and geese were flying, and when we got there, what
a feast awaited us! Some eagle-eyed observers clearly spotted
reindeer on its cliffs; others even more eagle-eyed plainly
distinguished the bucks from the does! Our mouths, dry from
chewing on salt beef, watered in eager anticipation.</p>

<p>De Long, positively glowing, hugged Dunbar for discovering
our island and looking happily off toward it, exclaimed,</p>

<p>“Fourteen months without anything but ice and sky makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
this look like an oasis in the desert! Look at it, it’s our all in
all! How bears must swarm on <em>our</em> island, Dunbar! And if
you want to tell me that it contains a gold mine that’ll make
us all as rich as the treasury without its debts, I’ll believe you!
<em>Our</em> island must have everything!”</p>

<p>Even the sick, who came up on deck for a glimpse, were
cheered by the sight, all, that is, save poor Danenhower, who
nevertheless came up with the others, at least to look in
that direction, knowing well enough that he alone of all of
us would never see our island; that through the heavily
smoked glass over his one remaining eye he could hardly see
the bulwarks, let alone the distant island we had at last
discovered!</p>

<p>Longer than anyone else, De Long stayed on deck that
night, gazing off toward the island, criticizing it, guessing
its distance, wishing for a favorable gale to drive us towards
it, and finally before going to bed, looking carefully again
at it to make sure it had not melted away.</p>

<p>And when at last I dragged him below to rest, he murmured
knowing well the island could be only at most a little
mass of volcanic rock,</p>

<p>“Melville, beside this stupendous island, the other events
of the day sink into insignificance!”</p>

<p>For the next week, we drifted northwest with fair speed
toward our island, with the water shoaling and the ice getting
more active. By several bearings as we moved along,
we discovered that when first sighted our island was thirty-four
miles off. The question of making a landing began
immediately to be debated, but obviously for the first few
days, we were not yet at the closest point, so no decision was
then arrived at. For the next three days, it blew hard, during
which time we caught but few glimpses of our island as we
drove northwest with the ice. When the gale abated on
May 24, we got some sights and found to our pleased surprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
that we were in latitude 77° 16′ N., longitude 159° 33′ E.
77° North! Another parallel of latitude left in our frozen
wake; we were now moving steadily on toward the Pole!</p>

<p>But that was not all for May 24. Going aloft himself in
the morning, De Long saw another island! Off to the westward
it lay, closer to us even than our first island; and in
addition, from all the lanes which had opened up in the pack,
more water than he had seen since September, 1879. This
second island, a little more calmly added to our discoveries
than the first one, was a most welcome sight. The water
however was nothing but a tantalizing vision, for none of the
lanes were connected nor did they lead anywhere, least of
all toward our islands, both about thirty miles away from
us and from each other.</p>

<p>Having two islands now on our hands, we could no longer
refer to the first simply as <em>our</em> island, as we had before lovingly
done in mentioning it, for was not the second equally
ours? So it becoming necessary to distinguish between them
in the future, De Long took thought like Adam of old, and
named them—the first after our ship and our ship’s godmother,
Jeannette Island; and the second after our sponsor’s mother,
Henrietta Island. Having thus taken care of our sponsor’s
sister and his mother, De Long looked confidently forward
to new discoveries on which he might bestow the name of
our sponsor himself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the question of landing on either or both of
our islands came again to the fore, the weather having cleared
once more. Jeannette Island had dropped astern during our
strong drift in the gale, while on Henrietta Island we were
closing steadily. De Long decided therefore on May 30, six
days after we had discovered it, to send a landing party over
the ice to take possession of Henrietta Island and to explore
it.</p>

<p>The journey would evidently be a dangerous one over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
broken and moving ice, with worst of all, the ship steadily
moving with the ice away from the land. Most opinions were
adverse to success, but Captain De Long ordered the trip,
feeling that a knowledge of that island as a base to fall back
on would be invaluable in case of disaster to the ship, and
exceedingly desirous also of erecting a stone cairn there in
which to leave a record of our wanderings and whereabouts
(this, I think, though De Long never expressed it so, as a permanent
clue to our fate should we be swallowed forever by
the pack threatening us).</p>

<p>Not as any compliment to me, but out of sheer necessity,
De Long selected me to take charge of the expeditionary
party and make the attempt to land. I was the only commissioned
officer of the Navy available; Danenhower, Chipp,
and Ambler were incapacitated in varying degree; the captain
himself, anxious as he was to have the honor of being first
to plant our flag on newly discovered soil, dared not leave
the ship to the only one other seagoing officer still on deck,
the whaler Dunbar. So by a process of simple elimination, I
was given the doubtful honor of leading. To help me were
assigned Mr. Dunbar and four picked men from the crew—Quartermaster
Nindemann and Erichsen, one of our biggest
seamen, from the deck force; with Bartlett, fireman, and
Sharvell, coalheaver, from my black gang, the latter to act
as cook.</p>

<p>With these men, one sledge, a dinghy to ferry us over any
open water, provisions for seven days (including forty-two
ounces of the inevitable lime-juice and eleven gallons of distilled
water but no tomatoes), navigating instruments, fifteen
dogs, and the silken ensign which Emma De Long had made
for the <em>Jeannette</em> as the particular banner to be used in taking
possession, we shoved off from the vessel’s side on May
31, cheered by all the remaining ship’s company. Henrietta
Island was twelve miles off over the pack, bearing southwest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
by west. The ship, to guide me in my return, hoisted a huge
black flag, eleven feet square at the main.</p>

<p>Our sledge carried between boat and supplies, a load of
1900 pounds, nearly a ton. With Dunbar running ahead as a
leader to encourage the dogs and the other five of us heaving
on the sledge to help along, it was as much as we could do
to get it underway and moving slowly over the rough ice
away from the ship. The harnessed dogs behaved as usual—they
were not interested in any cooperation with us. In the
first fifteen minutes, several broke out of harness and returned
to the ship, there of course to be recaptured by our
shipmates and dragged back to the sledge.</p>

<p>Of our terrible three day journey over only twelve miles
of live ice toward Henrietta Island, I have little to say save
that it was a nightmare. We made five miles the first day,
during which we lost sight of the <em>Jeannette</em> and her black
flag; and four miles the second. At that point, Mr. Dunbar,
who had been doing most of the guiding while the rest of
us pushed on the sledge to help the dogs, became in spite
of his dark glasses totally snow-blind and could no longer
see his way, even to stumble along over the ice in our wake.
So we perched him inside the dinghy, thus increasing our
load, and on the third day set out again in a snow storm,
guided now only by compass toward the invisible island. In
the afternoon, the storm suddenly cleared, and there half a
mile from us, majestic in its grandeur, stood the island! Precipitous
black cliffs, lifting a sheer four hundred feet above
the ice, towered over us; a little inland, four times that height,
rose cloud-wreathed mountains, with glaciers startlingly
white against the black peaks filling their every gorge.</p>

<p>As we stood there, awestruck at the spectacle, viewing this
unknown land on which man had never yet set foot, the
silence of those desolate mountains, awful and depressing,
gripped us, driving home the loneliness, the utter separation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
from the world of men of this Arctic island!</p>

<p>We were now only half a mile from the shore which
marked our goal, but as we gazed across it, cold dread seized
us. What a half mile! The drifting pack, in which miles away
the unresisting <em>Jeannette</em> was being carried along, was here
in contact with immovable mountains which could and did
resist. As a result, around the bases of those cliffs, were piled
up broken floes by the millions, the casualties in that incessant
combat between pack and rock. While moving past between
were vast masses of churning ice, forever changing shape,
tumbling and grinding away at each other as that stately procession
of floebergs hurried along. And it was over this pandemonium,
that if ever we were to plant our flag on that
island, we had to pass!</p>

<p>To get sledge, boat, and all our provisions across was utterly
hopeless. So I made a <em>cache</em> on a large floe of our dinghy,
stowing in it all except one day’s provisions and most of our
gear, raising an oar flying a small black flag vertically on the
highest hummock of that floe as a marker. Next there was
Dunbar. Terribly down in the mouth at having collapsed
and become nothing but a hindrance, he begged to be left
on the ice rather than encumber us further. But to leave an
old man blinded and helpless on a drifting floe which we
might never find again, was not to be thought of. In spite of
his distressed pleadings, I put him on the sledge together with
our scanty provisions and instruments, and then with a lashing
to the neck of the lead dog who had no intention whatever
of daring that devil’s churn, we started, myself in the
lead.</p>

<p>It was hell, over floes tossing one minute high in air, the
next sinking under our feet. Splashing, rolling, tumbling, we
scrambled from floe to floe, wet, frozen, terrified. Only by
big Erichsen’s truly herculean strength in bodily lifting out
the sledge when it stuck fast did we get over safely. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
at last, soaked and exhausted, we crawled up on the quiescent
ice fringing the island, we were barely able to haul Dunbar,
dripping like a seal, off the sledge and onto the more solid ice.</p>

<p>We paused there briefly while little Sharvell, his teeth still
chattering from fright, clumsily prepared our cold supper.
Then marching over the fixed ice, I as commander first set
foot on the island and in a loud voice claimed it as a possession
of the United States. I invited my shipmates ashore, and in
a formal procession led by Hans Erichsen (who as a special
reward was carrying our silken ensign) they landed also on
the island, where Erichsen proudly jammed the flagstaff into
the earth.</p>

<p>With a few precious drops (and precious few) of medicinal
whiskey, I christened the spot <span class="smcap">Henrietta Island</span>, after
which we six sick seamen drank the remainder of the medicine
in honor of the event, and then revelling in a brief tramp
over real earth for the first time in over twenty-one of the
longest months men have ever spent, we hauled our sleeping
bags about our weary bones and lay down, at last to rest again
on <em>terra firma</em>.</p>

<p>At ten a.m. we woke, startled to have slept so long, for we
were not to stay on the island longer than twenty-four hours.
On a bold headland nearby, we built our cairn, burying in
it two cases, one zinc and one copper, containing the records
with which Captain De Long had provided us. This promontory,
Mr. Dunbar named “Melville Head” in my honor,
but after considering its bareness of vegetation, I decided
“Bald Head” was more appropriate and so entered it on the
chart which I now proceeded to make.</p>

<p>With Bartlett and Erichsen reading instruments while I
sketched, we ran a compass survey which took all day. From
the high headlands, the <em>Jeannette</em> was plainly visible in the
ice to the northeast, a black speck against the white pack,
but we paid little attention to her, being anxious only to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
finish. While this was going on, Sharvell and Nindemann
searched the valleys, shooting a few of the birds nesting in
great profusion among the rocks. But aside from the birds
they saw no other game—no bears, no reindeer, no seals—not
a trace of animal life on that island.</p>

<p>In the early evening, our survey finished, we harnessed
again our staked-out dogs, furled our banner, and started
back.</p>

<p>Our retreat through the roaring ice about the island we
found even more difficult than our landing. On one small
floe, rounded like a whaleback, we took refuge for a moment
in that cascading ice. We clung on in terror when it
began rolling beneath us, evidently about to capsize. That to
our dismay it finally did, but providentially we were scraped
off as it went over onto the main floe. From this more solid
footing we dragged up out of the icy water by their harnesses
the drenched dogs and the even more drenched Dunbar
clinging to the submerged sledge.</p>

<p>Back once more on ice moving only as part of the great
Arctic pack, we breathed a little more freely, shook ourselves
like the dogs to get rid of surplus water before it froze on
us, and headed for the spot toward which I figured our
abandoned boat had drifted. There was nothing we could
recognize, there were none of our previous tracks we could
follow; the arrangement of that pack had changed as completely
as a shuffled deck of cards. Amongst high hummocks
we could see but a little distance and I was becoming thoroughly
alarmed at the prospect of never finding our boat
again. Then with the weather clearing a bit, from the top of
the highest hummock around, Erichsen spied in the distance
the oar marking our boat. We hastened toward it, truly
thankful, for we had already made away with the single day’s
rations which we had carried with us, and had no longer
a bite left to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>For two days in miserable weather we stumbled back toward
the ship, steering a compass course through continuous
snow. To add to our troubles, Nindemann came down with
severe cramps (lead, of course) and Erichsen, who since
Dunbar’s collapse had been guiding the dogs, with snow-blindness.
So pitching our tent in the snow, we camped our
second night, while I dragged out the medicine chest with
which I had been provided by Dr. Ambler and began to read
the directions. The remedy for cramps was “Tincture of
capsicum in cognac.” Henrietta Island having seen the last of
the cognac, the best liquid substitute available in the chest
appeared to be a bottle of sweet oil, which I drew out, together
with the bottle marked “Tinc. capsicum.”</p>

<p>My own fingers were cold and numbed, so Erichsen who
wanted some of the sweet oil to rub on his chafed body
which he had stripped for that purpose, volunteered to draw
the corks for me. First pouring some of the sweet oil over
his hands to soften them, he pulled the second cork, but so
clumsily with his frozen paws, that he spilled a liberal portion
of the tincture of capsicum over his badly chapped
hands to discover promptly that compared to tincture of
capsicum, liquid fire was a cooling, soothing lotion!</p>

<p>Startled, Erichsen involuntarily rubbed the mixture on his
bared rump and immediately went wild. To the intense interest
of his shipmates, down went Erichsen into the snow,
trying to extinguish the burn, wiggling his huge form like
a snake on fire. Little Sharvell, solicitously taking his arm,
piped up,</p>

<p>“’Ere, matey, let me lead you to a ’igher ’ummock! Bli’
me if I don’t think ye’ll soon melt yer way clean through
this floe!”</p>

<p>Nindemann began to laugh so hard at this that he completely
forgot his cramps, while Dunbar, between his own
groans, sang out cheerily,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“Hans, are ye hot enough yet to make the snow hiss? If
ye are, when we get back, the chief can put out the forecastle
stove and use ye for a heater!”</p>

<p>Amid the general merriment, joined in by all hands except
poor Hans, big Erichsen finally managed to cool himself
down in the snow enough so that he could stand an administration
of pure sweet oil to the affected parts. Carefully
applied by me, this soothed him enough to permit his dressing
again, and with most of us in a hilarious frame of mind,
we slid into our sleeping bags.</p>

<p>Next day, our sixth since departure, we set out again at
3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, and mirth having proved a better cure than medicine,
with all hands in fair shape except Dunbar who still had
to ride the sledge. Within an hour we sighted the ship. This
cheered us further. And the dogs recognizing the masts and
realizing that at last they were pulling toward home, for the
first time put their hearts and shoulders into the job. Over
bad ice, we made such excellent progress that by 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we
were within a mile of the ship, apparently without having
been sighted from there.</p>

<p>At this point, I ran into an open water lead with running
ice, and unable to find a detour, had determined to launch
the dinghy and ferry across when a sledge runner gave way
and left us flat in the snow. We repaired the runner, but it
was evident that it would never carry all the weight again.
So I unloaded the boat, ferried the sledge across, and then
sent it ahead with Dunbar only on it while Sharvell and I
stayed behind with the dinghy and all the rest of our sledge
load of equipment.</p>

<p>We were all soon sighted and a party came out from the
ship. There on the ice, Dr. Ambler met me, and undemonstrative
though he was, so overjoyed was he at our safe return
that he gave me a regular bear hug.</p>

<p>Approaching the gangway, we caught sight of Captain De<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
Long, enthusiastically waving to us from the deck, running
up the ladder to the bridge for a better view. Then to our
horror we saw him, absorbed only by our progress, step
directly into the path of the flying windmill! In an instant,
before anyone could cry out in warning, down came one
of the huge arms, whirling before a fresh breeze, hitting him
a terrific blow on the head and sending him reeling backwards
down the ladder!</p>

<p>Fortunately the quartermaster caught him, breaking his
fall, but Ambler and I, forgetting all else, rushed for the
gangway, arriving on deck to find the captain crawling on
hands and knees, stunned and bleeding from a great gash
in his head. Ambler hurriedly bent over him, carefully feeling
his skull, and announced thankfully there was no evident
fracture. He helped the semi-conscious captain to his cabin,
where he immediately went to work stitching up a deep four-inch
long wound. By the time this was done and the bandages
applied, De Long at last came out of his daze. But calloused
as I was by war and many hardships it nevertheless brought
tears to my eyes when his first question after his fluttering
eyelids opened on the doctor bending over him, was not
about himself but a faint query,</p>

<p>“How about Melville and his men, doctor? Are they all
safe?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">On June 5, 1881, a Sunday morning, we got back to the
<em>Jeannette</em>. In the early afternoon, in honor of our safe return.
De Long with his eyes hardly visible through his bandages,
conducted a Thanksgiving Service, attended only by Ambler
and myself, for the other two usual members of the congregation,
Chipp and Dunbar, were both on the sicklist. In
further celebration of the event, the captain ordered in the
evening the issue of a double ration of whiskey forward,
which ceremony conducted in the forecastle by Jack Cole
drew a somewhat larger attendance, I believe.</p>

<p>Our sicklist was now considerable—Danenhower, Chipp,
Newcomb, Dunbar, and Alexey, with the skipper himself
really belonging there, but nevertheless permitted by the doctor
to be up so long as he stayed off the ice for a few days
till his cut had a fair chance to start to heal. Chipp, Newcomb,
and Alexey were still badly off from lead poisoning,
but Tong Sing, our steward, had recovered sufficiently to go
back on duty and was now mainly engaged in tending the
sick when not actually serving.</p>

<p>From this unsatisfactory state of our personnel, I turned
my attention after a week’s absence once more to the <em>Jeannette</em>
and what was going on round her. Henrietta Island
was rapidly dropping abaft our beam as we drifted westward
past its northern side and it was evident that we would soon
drop it out of sight. Jeannette Island had already vanished
from our world.</p>

<p>But the action of the ice about us attracted most attention.
Not since November, 1879, had we seen so much moving ice
near the ship, the effect undoubtedly of nearby Henrietta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
Island. The day after my return, we found our floe reduced
to an ice island about a mile one way and half of that the
other, with ourselves about a hundred yards from the western
edge, while all about us was a tumbling procession of floebergs,
shrieking and howling as they rolled past. Leads
opened and closed endlessly in the near distance with ridges
of broken floes shooting thirty feet above the pack. The
roaring of the breaking floes sounded like continuous thunder.
And in all this turmoil our ice island with the <em>Jeannette</em>
in it moved majestically along. Meanwhile we from our
decks regarded it, thankful that our floe was not breaking
up to crush our ship and leave our heavy boats and sledges
to the mercies of that chaos, a half mile of which with a
sledge lightly loaded only, off Henrietta Island we had barely
managed to survive.</p>

<p>Another day passed, leaving the island in our wake. The
moving ice closed up again with long rows of piled up floes
all about us, one huge ridge of blocks seven to eight feet
thick riding the pack not a hundred and fifty yards away
from our bulwarks. And yet one more day and the captain
got a sight, showing we were going due west at a fair rate,
which if continued, unless we turned north, would ultimately
bring us out into the Atlantic, though the chances seemed
better for a resumption of our northwest drift toward the
Pole. But toward either of these, now that we had some discoveries
to add to the world’s charts, we looked forward
hopefully. At any rate, since we had to leave the matter to
the pack, for the present our motto was obviously “Westward
ho!”</p>

<p>June 10th came with our drift still steadily westward, clear
weather, and the temperature about 25° F., well below freezing
though above zero, which for us made it very pleasant
weather. Alexey came off the sicklist, and so also did Dunbar;
leaving only Chipp as a bedridden case, and Newcomb,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
up but acting as if he were exceedingly miserable, which I
guess he was. Danenhower, permanently on the sicklist, was
allowed on deck an hour a day for exercise that the doctor
hoped would gradually restore his health and save his one
good eye, which now showed some signs of getting over
its sympathetic inflammation. During these hourly periods,
Dan was sternly ordered to keep in the shade and wear his
almost opaque shield, but unfortunately our overbold navigator
stepped out into the sun and pulled aside the glass, attempting
to get at least one decent look around. Instead he
had an instant relapse of his inflamed eye which nearly drove
both Ambler and the captain wild.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the captain had had all his bandages save one
small one removed from his injured skull by now, or I think
he would have ripped them off in his attempts to tear his
hair over the results of Dan’s reckless disobedience.</p>

<p>Except for this unfortunate mishap, June 10 passed away
pleasantly enough. With no more thought than that it was
just another day in the pack, most of us turned in at 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,
concerned only about whether our drift next day would continue
west or change to northwest. But I, having the watch
from 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> to midnight, remained on deck. At 11 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, I
was disturbed by a succession of heavy shocks to the ship
which increased in frequency till as midnight approached
there was such a thumping and thundering of cracking ice
about us and so much reverberation as the shocks drummed
against our hollow hull, that the uneasy deck beneath me
quivered as I had not felt it since two years before when
we had been underway with all sail set. So violent was this
disturbance that De Long, asleep below, lost all thought of
rest, pulled on his clothes and scrambled on deck to see what
was up.</p>

<p>With the sun even at midnight above the horizon, he had
little difficulty seeing, and of course none at all in hearing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
About eighty yards from us, a lane had opened in the pack
some ten feet wide, while all about us as we watched, cracks
were zigzagging across the surface of our floe to the accompaniment
of thunderous detonations as the thick ice split.
And all the while, the heavily listed <em>Jeannette</em>, still fast in the
ice, rocked in her bed as in an earthquake.</p>

<p>For ten trying minutes this went on, and then with a terrific
report like a bomb exploding, the floe split wide apart
beneath us, the <em>Jeannette</em> lurched wildly to port and suddenly
slid out of her cradle into open water! There she rolled
drunkenly for a moment, till coming finally erect she lay
free of the ice at last in a swiftly widening bay!</p>

<p>So rapidly did all this happen that the skipper, clinging to
the rail of his reeling bridge, saw the situation change from
that of a ship frozen in to one underway before he could
give a single order. But immediately after, with the ship
still rocking heavily,</p>

<p>“All hands!” was echoing fore and aft, and I rushed below
to close the gates in our watertight bulkheads and stand by
my steam pumps, not knowing what effect this sudden release
of our bow from the ice might have on that leak we
had been pumping, so it seemed, forever. Paradoxically,
however, the leak immediately decreased, probably because
our freed stem floated several feet higher than before, so I
returned quickly on deck to find the crew under the captain’s
directions busily engaged in preparing to re-ship our
long-disused rudder. This, delayed by frozen gudgeons, took
some hours. But when it was completed, and everything
meanwhile had been cleared away from booms and yards for
making sail, the <em>Jeannette</em> for the first time since 1879
(though we never saw the irony of that till later) was again
ready to maneuver as a ship.</p>

<p>Amidst the hoarse orders of the bosun and the noise of
seamen clearing running rigging and scrambling out on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
frosty yards to loose the preventer lashings on the long-unused
sails, I climbed to the bridge. There I found De Long
calmly smoking his pipe while he eyed the smooth black
water in our bay, now perhaps a quarter of a mile wide between
the separated edges of our late island.</p>

<p>“Shall I fire up the main boilers, captain, and couple up the
propeller shaft?” I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“How much coal have you left, chief?” he countered.</p>

<p>“Only fifteen tons, sir.”</p>

<p>Fifteen tons. That would keep us going only three days
normal steaming. De Long thought a moment.</p>

<p>“No, chief, don’t light off. There’s no place for the engines
to take us anyway and we might burn up all our fuel just
lying here. Save the coal; we may need it to keep us from
freezing next winter. We’ll make sail if we have to move,
but just now, all we can do is get some lines ashore and tie
up to that starboard floe, till we see what the pack is about.”</p>

<p>So instead of trying to move, Cole ran out the lines to
ice-anchors on our bow and quarter and we moored to the
floe.</p>

<p>Then began a desperate fight with De Long struggling to
save his ship should the ice close in again before it broke up
completely and let us escape. A measurement nearby showed
the ice sixteen feet thick; deeper than our keel. If the pack,
pressing in on us now, got a fair grip on our sides, we should
be squeezed between thicker ice than ever before we had
been, in a giant nutcracker indeed. But what could we do
about it? The water lead was short, there was no escape
from it ahead or astern. Just one chance offered itself. A little
ahead of where we lay, on our port bow was a narrow canal
joining two wider bays in the parted pack. If we could only
fill that canal up with heavy floes, they might take the major
thrust of the closing pack, thus saving us from the full
pressure. Savagely the men on watch turned to and fought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
with lines and grapnels, hooking loose floebergs everywhere
and dragging them through the water into that canal, anchoring
them there as best they could.</p>

<p>We had made fair progress on filling the gap, when at
7:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the ice started to advance. The sight of that massive
pack slowly closing on us like the jaws of doom, quickened
our muscles, and we strained like madmen shoving drifting
ice into the opening ahead. Just then, as if playing with us,
the pack halted dead, giving us a better chance to finish the
job.</p>

<p>De Long came down off the bridge to encourage the men
with the grapnels. Standing on the edge of the canal, directing
the work, was our ice-pilot. Approaching him along the
brink of the pack, the captain looked down through the cold
sea at the submerged edge of the floe, the blue-white ice
there glimmering faintly through the water till lost in the
depths; then he looked back at the <em>Jeannette</em> with her tall
masts and spreading yards erect and square at last across the
Arctic sky, while her stout hull, stark black against the ice,
seemed grimly to await the onslaught.</p>

<p>“Well, Dunbar,” asked the skipper, “what do you think
of it?”</p>

<p>Dunbar, worn and dour, had his mind made up.</p>

<p>“No use doing this, cap’n,” he replied dully, indicating the
men heaving on the grapnel lines. “Before tonight, she’ll
either be under this floe or on top of it! Better start those
men, instead o’ hauling ice, at getting overboard the emergency
provisions!”</p>

<p>De Long shook his head. He couldn’t agree. In terrible
winter weather, the sturdy <em>Jeannette</em> had often beaten the
pack before; he couldn’t believe that she would fail us now.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock, the ice started to advance once more. Our
job in plugging the canal was finished. We had done all that
man could do. Now it was up to the <em>Jeannette</em>. But as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
watched that pack come on, flat floes and tilted floebergs
thick and jagged, urged forward by endless miles of surging
ice behind, our hearts sank. In spite of our thick sides and
heavy trusses, the contest between hollow ship and solid
pack looked so unequal.</p>

<p>On came the pack. The bay narrowed, thinned down to
a ribbon of water on our port side, vanished altogether. The
attacking floes reached our sides, started to squeeze. The
<em>Jeannette</em>, tightly gripped, began to screech and groan from
end to end. With bow lifted and stem depressed, she heeled
sharply 16° to starboard, thrown hard against the floe there,
while we grabbed frantically at whatever was at hand to
avoid being hurled into the scuppers. Then to our intense
relief, the ice we had pushed into the canal ahead came into
play, took the further thrust, and stopped the advance, so
that for the moment everything quieted down, leaving our
ship in a precarious position, but at least intact. Our spirits
rose. Perhaps we had saved her!</p>

<p>Thus we lay for two hours till eight bells struck. Cole, a
little uncertain as to routine now, glanced up at the bridge.
De Long nodded, so Cole piped down for mess, and with our
ship pretty well on her beam ends, one watch laid below.
There clinging to the stanchions, they ate the dinner which
the imperturbable Ah Sam, still cooking in all that turmoil,
had somehow, by lashing his pots down on the tilted galley
range perhaps, managed to prepare.</p>

<p>At two bells, mess was over and most of us on deck again,
hanging to the port rail. Soon we got another jam, listing us
a little further and still more raising our tilted bow, but the
<em>Jeannette</em> took it well and I did not consider it anything
serious, when suddenly, to everybody’s alarm, my machinist
Lee, whose station at the time was down on the fireroom
floor running the little distiller boiler, shot out the machinery
hatch to the deck, shouting,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>“We’re sinking! The ice is coming through the side!”</p>

<p>“Pipe down there, Lee!” ordered the captain sharply.
“Don’t go screaming that way to all hands like a scared old
woman. You’re an experienced seaman; if you’ve got any
report to make, make it to me as if you were one! Come up
here!”</p>

<p>Lee, white and shaking, climbed up the bridge ladder, his
wound-weakened hips threatening to collapse under him.
The captain beckoned me, then faced Lee.</p>

<p>“What is it now, Lee?”</p>

<p>“Her seams are opening below, sir! The sides are giving
way!”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” asked De Long bruskly. “What are you
frightened at then? Here, Melville; lay below with him and
find out what’s wrong!”</p>

<p>With the reluctant Lee following, I climbed down into
the fireroom. There was no water there.</p>

<p>“What in hell’s the matter with you, Lee?” I asked angrily.
“Do you want to shame me and the whole black gang for
cowards? What set you off?”</p>

<p>“Look there, chief!” cried the agitated machinist. He led
me into the starboard side bunker. We were well below the
waterline. The air there was so full of flying coal dust it was
difficult to breathe, and as the ship thumped against the
ice outside, new clouds of dust continuously rose from our
panting sides. “Look at that! She’s going fast!” yelled Lee,
indicating with his torch. I looked.</p>

<p>The closely-fitted seams in the thick layer of planking
forming our inner skin had sprung apart an inch or more,
and as we watched, these cracks opened and closed like an
accordion with startling frequency; but outboard of that
layer we had a double thickness of heavy planking which
constituted our outer shell, and though I could see traces of
oakum squeezing out of the seams there, that outer planking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
pressed by the ice hard in against the massive timbers of our
ribs and trusses, was holding beautifully and there were no
leaks.</p>

<p>“Keep your head next time, Lee,” I advised gruffly as I
came out of the bunker. “We’re doing fine! Now mind that
distiller, and don’t salt up the water!” Blinking my eyes
rapidly to clear them of coal dust, I climbed on deck to
inform the captain that there was no cause for alarm—yet.</p>

<p>So we lay for the next two hours, with the poor <em>Jeannette</em>
groaning and panting like a woman in labor as the pack
worked on her. At six bells, the captain, confident now that
the worst was over and that she would pull through, took
sudden thought of the future. The ship was a remarkable
sight; what a picture she would make to print in the <em>Herald</em>
on her return.</p>

<p>“Melville,” said the captain, puffing calmly away at his
meerschaum, “take the camera out on the ice and see what
you can get in the way of a photograph.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p>Early in the voyage, when Collins had been relieved of
that task, I had become official photographer. I went to the
darkroom, got out the camera, tripod, black hood, and a
few of the plates which I myself had brought along and for
which I had a developer. Stepping from our badly listed
starboard rail directly onto the ice there, I picked a spot
about fifty yards off on the starboard bow and set up my
clumsy rig.</p>

<p>The view was marvelous. Heeling now 23° to starboard,
the spar deck, covered with men clinging to the rigging, the
rails, and the davits to keep from sliding into the scuppers,
showed up clearly; while with her black hull standing sharply
out against the white pack, and with bow and bowsprit
pointing high in air and stem almost buried, the <em>Jeannette</em>
looked like a vessel lifting while she rolled to a huge ice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
wave. Never again would I see a ship like that!</p>

<p>I exposed a plate, then, for insurance, another; and folding
up my rig, stumbled back over the ice to the ship, laid below
to the darkroom on the berth deck, poured out my chemicals
and proceeded with much difficulty (because of the extraordinary
list) to develop the plates, which in that climate
had to be done immediately or they would spoil. In the
vague red light of a bull’s-eye lantern, I was struggling in
the darkroom with this job, when the ship got a tremendous
squeeze, the berth deck buckled up under my feet, and
amidst the roar of cracking timbers, I heard Jack Cole’s shout,</p>

<p>“All Hands! Stations for Abandon Ship!”</p>

<p>Leaving the plates in the solution but extinguishing the
red lantern, I hastily closed the darkroom door and ran on
deck.</p>

<p>“Water coming up now in all the holds! I think that last
push tore the keel out of her!” announced the captain briefly
as I ran by him toward the cabin to get out the chronometers
and the compasses. “I’m afraid she’s through at last, chief!”</p>

<p>Behind me as I ran, I heard in rapid succession the orders
to lower away the boats, to push overboard the sledges, and
to commence passing out on the ice our emergency store
of pemmican. Carefully I lifted out the two chronometers and
the four small compasses which it was my job to save. Below
me I could hear water gushing up into the afterhold, while
from above on the poop deck came the creaking of frozen
cordage and blocks as the falls ran out and our heavy boats
dropped to the ice. As tenderly as I could, I gripped the
chronometers, sprang out on the ice, and deposited my
burden in the first cutter, already hauled a little clear of the
ship’s side.</p>

<p>The next few minutes, against a background of rushing
water, screeching ice, and crunching timbers, were a blur of
heaving over the side and dragging well clear our pemmican,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
sledges, boats, and supplies. Lieutenant Chipp, so sick in his
berth that he could not stand, was dressed by Danenhower,
and then the two invalids went together over the side, the
half-blinded navigator carrying the executive officer who
guided him.</p>

<p>I got up my knapsack from my stateroom, tossed it into
the cabin in the poop, and then turned to on our buckled
deck in getting overboard our stores while below us the ship
was flooding fast. De Long, himself checking the provisions
as they went over the side, looked anxiously round the spar
deck, then asked sharply of the bosun,</p>

<p>“Where’s the lime-juice?”</p>

<p>Our last cask of lime-juice, only one-third full now, was
nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>“Down in the forehold, sor,” said Cole briefly.</p>

<p>The forehold? Hopeless to get at anything there; the forehold
was already flooded. De Long’s face fell. There would
be no distilled water any more; no more vegetables at all;
nothing but pemmican to eat and salty snow from the floes
to drink on our retreat over the ice, a bad combination for
scurvy. The solitary anti-scorbutic we could carry was that
lime-juice. He had to have it.</p>

<p>“Get it up!” ordered De Long savagely.</p>

<p>“I’ll try, sor,” answered the bosun dubiously. He went forward
accompanied by several seamen, peered down from the
spar deck into that hold. Water was already pouring in a
torrent from the forehold hatch, cascading away over the
berth deck into the lee scuppers. It was impossible to get
into the hold except by swimming down against the current
through a narrow crack left in the hatch opening on
the high port side which, the ship being so badly listed to
starboard, was still exposed. Yet even if a man got through,
what could he do in the blackness of the swirling water
in that flooded hold to find and break out the one right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
cask among dozens of others submerged there? But then
that barrel, being only partly full, might be floating on the
surface on the high side to port. There was a slight chance.
Jack Cole looked round at the rough seamen about him.</p>

<p>“Any of yez a foine swimmer?” he asked, none too hopefully,
for aside from the danger in this case, sailors are
notoriously poor swimmers.</p>

<p>“I try vot I can do maybe, bosun.” A man stepped forth,
huge Starr, our Russian seaman (his name probably a contraction
of Starovski), the biggest man on board. “Gif me a
line.”</p>

<p>Swiftly Cole threw a bowline round Starr’s waist. No
use giving him a light; the water pouring through would
extinguish it. He would have to grope in blackness. Starr
dropped down to the berth deck. Standing in the water on
the low side of the hatch, he stooped, with a shove of his
powerful legs pushed himself through against the current,
and vanished with a splash into the flooded hold. Cole started
to pay out line.</p>

<p>How Starr, swimming in ice water in that Stygian hole
amidst all sorts of floating wreckage there, ever hoped to
find that one barrel, I don’t know. But he did know that
the ship, flooded far above the point at which she should
normally sink, was held up only by the ice, and that if for
an instant, the pack should suddenly relax its grip, she would
plunge like a stone and while the others on the spar deck
might escape, he, trapped in the hold, would go with her.</p>

<p>With a thumping heart, Jack Cole “fished” the line on
Starr, paying out, taking in, as the unseen swimmer fumbled
amongst the flotsam in the black hold. Then to his astonishment,
the lime-juice cask popped up through the hatch and
following it, blowing like a whale, came Starr! Another instant
and Starr, tossing the barrel up like a toy, was back
on the spar deck, where all coming aft, Jack Cole proudly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
presented his dripping seaman and the precious cask on his
shoulder, to the captain.</p>

<p>De Long, with his ship sinking under him, paused a
moment to shake Starr’s hand.</p>

<p>“A brave act, Starr, and a very valuable one. I’m proud
of you! I’ll not forget it. Now, bosun, get Starr here a stiff
drink of whiskey from those medical stores on the ice to
thaw him out!”</p>

<p>The lime-juice, still borne by Starr, went over the side,
the last of our provisions. The floes round about the <em>Jeannette</em>
were littered with boats, sledges, stores, and an endless variety
of everything else we could pitch overboard. With our supplies
gone, I tried to get down again on the berth deck aft to
my stateroom to salvage my private possessions, but I was
too late. The water was rising rapidly there, and was already
halfway up the wardroom ladder, so I went back into the
cabin in the poop above, where I had before tossed my knapsack,
to retrieve it and get overboard myself.</p>

<p>The deck of the cabin was a mess of the personal belongings
of all the wardroom officers—clothes, papers, guns, instruments,
bearskins, stuffed gulls, that heavy walrus head
over which Sharvell had once been so concerned (and apparently
now, rightly) and Heaven knows what else. Pawing
over the conglomerate heap was Newcomb, uncertain as to
what he should try to save. As I retreated upwards into the
cabin before the water rising on the wardroom ladder, De
Long stepped into the cabin also from his upper deck stateroom,
and seeing only Newcomb fumbling over the enormous
pile of articles, inquired casually,</p>

<p>“Mr. Newcomb, is this all <em>your</em> stuff?”</p>

<p>Pert as ever in spite of his illness, Newcomb replied with
the only statement from him that ever made me grin,</p>

<p>“No, sir; it’s only part of it!”</p>

<p>And even the captain, broken-hearted over his ship, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
at that vast heap, stopped to laugh at that.</p>

<p>But from the way the deck was acting beneath me, there
was little time for mirth, so I seized my knapsack and walking
more on the bulkhead than on the deck, got outside the
poop, followed by the captain carrying some private papers,
and Newcomb lugging only a shotgun.</p>

<p>Things moved rapidly now on the doomed <em>Jeannette</em>. The
ship started to lay far over on her beam ends, water rose
to the starboard rail, the smokestack broke off at its base,
hanging only by the guys; and then the ship, given another
squeeze by the crowding ice, collapsed finally, with her
crumpled deck bulging slowly upward, her timbers snapping,
and the men in the port watch who were trying to snatch a
last meal forward from scraps in the galley, finding their
escape up the companionway ladder cut off by suddenly
rising water, pouring like flies out through the forecastle
ventilator to slide immediately overboard onto the ice.</p>

<p>It was no longer possible, even on hands and knees, to
stay on that fearfully listed deck. Clinging to the shrouds,
De Long ordered Cole to hoist a service ensign to the mizzen
truck, and then with a last look upward over the almost
vertical deck to see that all had cleared her, he waved his
cap to the flag aloft, cried chokingly,</p>

<p>“Good-by, old ship!” and leaped from the rigging to the
ice.</p>

<p>Flooded, stove in, and buckled up, the <em>Jeannette</em> was a
wreck. The pack had conquered her at last. Only that death
grip with which the floes still clung tenaciously to her kept
her afloat. With heavy hearts we turned our backs on the
remains of that valiant ship, our home and our shield from
peril for two long years, and looked instead southward where
five hundred miles away across that terrible pack and the
Arctic Sea lay the north coast of Siberia and possible safety—if
we could ever get there.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Our situation was now truly desperate. There we were,
thirty-three men cast away on drifting ice floes, our whereabouts
and our fate, whether yet alive or long since dead,
totally unknown to the world we had left two years before,
completely beyond the reach of any possible relief expedition.
Five hundred miles away at the Lena Delta lay the
nearest shore, where from the charts in our possession, we
might expect to fall in on that frozen coast with native huts
and villages such as long before we had visited at Cape Serdze
Kamen, and find even a slight pretense of food and shelter
and perhaps a little aid in getting over the next thousand
miles south into Siberia itself to civilization at Yakutsk.</p>

<p>How much of that five hundred miles before us was ice
and how much was water, nobody knew. That a part of it,
just north of Siberia, was likely to be water in the summer
time was certain, so we must drag our boats with us across
the pack between us and that open sea or else ultimately,
unable to cross it, perish when we came to the fringe of the
ice pack. A few uninhabited islands, the New Siberian Archipelago,
lay halfway along the route, but we could expect
no aid there of any kind nor any food. Grimly ironic on our
Russian charts was the notice that all visitors were prohibited
from landing on the New Siberian Islands unless they
brought with them their own food, since the last party
permitted a few years before to go there as fossil ivory hunters
had all starved to death for lack of game.</p>

<p>But at the Lena Delta, the charts showed permanent settlements,
and a book we had of Dr. Petermann’s described in
considerable detail the villages and mode of life there. Magazine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
articles published and taken with us just before we left
San Francisco indicated that the Russian government was
then in 1879 about to open the Lena River for trading steamers
from its mouth to Yakutsk, a thousand miles inland. Since
it was now the middle of 1881 that should be completed and
the river steamers running.</p>

<p>So “On to the Lena Delta!” became our object in life, and
to the Delta we looked forward as our Promised Land. But
getting there seemed next to impossible. We were well acquainted
with all previous Arctic expeditions. Not one in
that long and tragic history stretching back three centuries,
when disaster struck their ships, had ever faced a journey
over the polar pack back to safety half so long as what
faced us, and some on far shorter marches over the ice had
perished to the last man!</p>

<p>Gloomily we faced our situation. We would have to drag
our boats; we would have to drag our food; we were handicapped
by one half-blind officer, by another too weak to
stand, by several men, Alexey and Kuehne mainly, who,
thrown on the ice, promptly had had a severe relapse of
cramps from lead poisoning, and by the knowledge that many
others of the crew were weakened by it and might break
down at any time.</p>

<p>But worst of all we had to face was the pack itself.
The most wretched season of the year for traveling over it
was thrust upon us. Under the bright sun, the snow was too
soft now to bear our sledges on its crust, but the temperature,
from 10° to 25° F., was too low to melt it and clear it from
our path. And as for the rough pack ice itself, I knew best
of all what traveling over that meant—the twelve mile journey
to Henrietta Island with a far lighter load per man and
dog, had nearly finished me and my five men. And here, how
many hundreds of miles of such ice we had to cross, God
alone knew!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>The loads we had to drag across the ice if we were to survive,
were enough to stagger the stoutest hearts. To carry
our party over the open water when we reached it, required
three boats and the three boats weighed four tons. And to
keep ourselves alive over the minimum time in which we
could hope with any luck at all to reach Siberia, sixty days,
required three and a half tons of food. Seven and a half
tons at least of total deadweight to be dragged over broken
Arctic ice on a journey as long as the distance from
New York halfway to Chicago! And the dragging to be
done practically altogether (for at most our twenty-three
remaining dogs could be expected to drag only one heavy
sledge out of our total of eight) by men as beasts of burden—before
that prospect we all but wilted.</p>

<p>But it was drag or die, and George Washington De Long
was determined that not one man should die if he had to
kill him to prevent it. For over De Long from the moment
we were thrown on the ice had come a hardness and a determination
which were new to us. Gone was the gravely
courteous scholar, interested mainly in scientific discovery,
scrupulously anxious to hurt no one’s feelings if it could be
avoided. The Arctic ice had literally folded up his scientific
expedition beneath his feet, closing the books at 77° North,
in his eyes practically a complete failure. That part was
all over, gone with the ship, and with it vanished the scientist
and the explorer whom we thought we knew. In his place,
facing the wilderness of ice about us, stood now a strange
naval officer with but a single purpose in his soul—the fierce
determination to get his men over that ice back to the Lena
Delta regardless of their hardships, regardless of their sufferings,
to keep them on their feet tugging at those inhuman
burdens even when they preferred to lie down in the snow
and die in peace.</p>

<p>For five days after the crushing of our ship, we camped on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
the floes nearby, sorting out stores, loading sledges, distributing
clothes, and incidentally nursing the sick. What
he should take along was in the forefront of every man’s
mind. We had salvaged far more of everything than we could
possibly drag—what should be left behind? De Long abruptly
settled the question with an order limiting what was to be
taken to three boats, sixty days’ food, the ship’s papers and
records, navigating outfits, and the clothes each man wore
including his sleeping bag and his knapsack, the contents
of which were strictly prescribed. All else, regardless of
personal value or desirability, must be thrown away. That
was particularly trying to the men in freezing weather
greedily eyeing the huge pile of furs, clothes, and blankets
tossed aside to be abandoned on the ice, but there was the
order—wear what you pleased in fur or cloth, trade what you
had for anything in the pile if it pleased you more, but when
you were dressed in the clothes of your choice, you left all
else behind. The solitary article excepted was fur boots or
moccasins; of these each of us could have three pairs, one
on, one in his knapsack, and one in his sleeping bag along
with his (half only) blanket.</p>

<p>But with the exception of much grumbling over the clothing
to be left behind, there was no need of orders to enforce
among the crew at least the abandonment of other weights;
all the grumbling there was over what the captain ordered
taken. Improvident as ever, the seamen growled over dragging
so much pemmican, growled over dragging lime-juice,
growled most of all over dragging the books and records of
the expedition. But they didn’t growl in the captain’s presence.
In range now of the steely glitter of those hard blue
eyes, strangely new to them, they only jumped to obey. Still,
among themselves (and I was always with them now) there
was a continual growl over the loads building up on the
sledges, and as for what articles they were themselves to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
carry, I saw seamen weighing sheath knife against jack-knife
to determine which was lighter, and then tossing the heavier
one away.</p>

<p>The start of our life on the ice the night we lost our ship
was inauspicious. Dead tired from superhuman laboring, first
in hurriedly getting stores off the ship and then in dragging
them over the ice to what looked like a safe floe two hundred
yards away from her, we turned in at midnight, camping
in five small tents, five or six men and an officer in each,
stretched out in a row on a common rubber mackintosh. At
one a.m., with a loud bang the floe beneath us split, the
crack running right through De Long’s tent, and the ice
promptly opened up. Had it not been for the weight of the
sleepers on the ends of the mackintosh there, the men sleeping
in the middle would immediately have been dumped
down the crevice into the sea! Even so, practically helpless
in their sleeping bags, they were rescued with difficulty,
while all the rest of us, weary as we were, hastily turned
out to move our whole camp across the widening crack to
another floe. By two a.m., this was done, and again we
turned in, leaving only Kuehne on watch. At four a.m., as
he was calling Bartlett, his relief, from my tent, he announced
suddenly,</p>

<p>“Turn out if you want to see the last of the <em>Jeannette</em>!
There she goes, there she goes!”</p>

<p>I leaped up and out of the tent. There was the listed
<em>Jeannette</em> coming slowly upright over the pack, for all the
world like a ghost rising from a snowy tomb. The floes
holding the ship, as if satisfied at having fully crushed the
life from her, were evidently backing away. She came erect,
her spars rattling and creaking dismally as she rose, then
the ice opening further, she started to sink with accelerating
speed. Quickly the black hull disappeared, then her yards
banged down on the ice, stripped from the masts, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
another instant, over the fore-topmast, the last bit of her I
ever saw, the dark waters closed and the sturdy <em>Jeannette</em>
had sunk, gone to an ocean grave beneath the Arctic floes!</p>

<p>I stood a moment in the cold air (the temperature had
dropped to 10° F.) with bared head, a silent mourner but
thankful that we had not gone with her, then crawled sadly
back to my sleeping bag.</p>

<p>On the sixth day after the crushing of the ship, our
goods were sorted, our sledges all packed, and we were
ready to go southward. Eight sledges, heavily loaded with
our three boats and our provisions, carried about a ton each;
a ninth sledge, more lightly loaded carrying our lime-juice,
our whiskey, and our medical stores, was considered the
hospital sledge; while a tenth, carrying only a small dinghy
for temporary work in ferrying over leads, completed our
cavalcade.</p>

<p>To minimize the glare of the ice and the strain of working
under a brilliant (but not a hot sun) all our traveling was to
be done at night when the midnight sun was low in the
heavens, with our camping and sleeping during the day when
the sun being higher, his more direct rays might be better
counted on to dry out our soaked clothing.</p>

<p>At 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on June 17th, we started, course due south.</p>

<p>Our first day’s journey was a heart-wrenching nightmare
which no man there was like to forget till his dying gasp.
The dogs were unable to drag even their one sledge; it took
six men in addition to keep it moving. And so bad was the
snow through which the sledges sank and floundered, that
we found it took our entire force heaving together against
their canvas harnesses to advance the boats and their sledges
one at a time against the snow banking up under the bows
of the clumsy boats.</p>

<p>Dunbar had gone ahead, planting four black flags at intervals
to mark the path which he as pilot had selected for us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
to follow, the fourth and last flag, only a mile and a half along
from the start, being the end of our first night’s journey.
But so terrible was the going that by morning only one
boat, the first cutter, had reached that last flag; the runners
had collapsed under three of the sledges, stalling them; a
wide lead had unexpectedly opened up in a floe halfway
down our road, blocking the other sledges and requiring
them to be unloaded and ferried over it; Chipp (who, with
Alexey and Kuehne, in spite of being the sick were dragging
the hospital sledge) had fainted dead away in the snow;
Lauterbach and Lee had both collapsed in their harnesses,
Lauterbach with cramps in his stomach, Lee with cramps
in his legs; and by 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, when our night’s journey should
have been finished and all hands at the last flag pitching
camp, we had instead broken down and blocked sledges
scattered over that mile and a half of pack ice from one
end to the other!</p>

<p>It was sickening. Twelve hours of man-killing effort and
we had made good over the ice not even one and a half
miles!</p>

<p>Willy-nilly, we made camp, breakfasted, and turned in
at 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, for our exhausted men could do no more without
a rest. But for Surgeon Ambler, there was no rest. While
the remainder of us, dead to the world, slumbered that day,
Ambler, who as much as anyone the night before had toiled
with the sledges along that heartbreaking road, labored over
the sick, struggling to get them on their feet again for what
faced them that evening.</p>

<p>That night we turned to once more, repairing runners,
shifting loads, digging sledges out of snowbanks in which
they were buried, and fighting desperately to advance all
to the first camp. Regardless of a temperature of 20° F.,
we perspired as if in the tropics, and tossing aside our parkas,
worked in our undershirts in the snow. All that night and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
next night also, we labored thus. By the second morning following,
thank God, we had all our boats and sledges together
there, and tumbled again into our sleeping bags, wearied
mortals if ever there were such on this earth! Three nights
of hell to make a mile and a half of progress! It was worse
even than my journey to Henrietta Island had led me to believe
could be possible.</p>

<p>And then that day, of all things in the Arctic, it started
to <em>rain</em>! Miserable completely, we sat or lay in our leaking
tents, soaked, muscle-weary, and frozen, while the cold rain
trickled over us and over the icy floors of our tents. But
while I had thought no creatures could possibly be suffering
greater misery than we, I changed my mind when I saw
our dogs, cowering in the rain, snuggle against our tent
doors, begging to be admitted to such poor shelter as we
had. So soon, with men and beasts shivering all together,
the picture of our misery was completed.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, Starr opening up the rations for
our midnight dinner, found in a coffee can a note addressed
to the captain, which he brought to him. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is to express my best wishes for success in your
great undertaking. Hope when you peruse these lines you
will be thinking of the comfortable homes you left behind
you for the purpose of aiding science. If you can make it
convenient drop me a line. My address,</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="padding-right: 2em">G. J. K—,</span><br>
Box 10, New York City.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“<em>Apropos</em>, eh, Melville? I guess we’re thinking of those
homes, all right,” commented De Long bitterly, showing me
the note. “Where’s the nearest post-box so I can drop that
imbecile a line?” Nearby was a crack in the floe. “Ah, right
here.” De Long scribbled his initials on the note, drew an
arrow pointing to the writer’s address, and dropped it into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
the crack. “Now we’ll see how good the seagoing Arctic
mail service is. At that, it may get to New York before we
do,” added the captain grimly.</p>

<p>Before we moved off from this camp, the captain decided
to check the loads to make sure we were taking nothing
more than was absolutely necessary. The first thing he discovered
was that flouting his order about clothing, Collins
had smuggled into our baggage and was taking along an
extra fur coat. Immediately, under the captain’s angry eye,
it went flying out on the ice. And the next thing he found
was that in their knapsacks (which were towed along stowed
inside the whaleboat) the seamen almost without exception
were taking some small mementoes of the cruise, trifling in
weight in themselves, in the aggregate under our circumstances,
a considerable burden. They went sliding out on
the ice alongside Collins’ coat.</p>

<p>And then having cleaned house, the captain waited for
the rain to end.</p>

<p>Since it rained all night, we stayed in camp, getting a rest
if such it can be called. Next night we were underway again
on a new schedule, the load of supplies on each sledge now
cut in half (except of course for the boat sledges) the idea
being to lighten up our overloaded sledges so we could
move them to the designated point more easily and with
less danger of breaking runners, then unload and send them
back empty for the other half of their cargoes. Working
this way we started out, only to find half a mile along a
crack in the ice, not wide enough for a ferry, too wide
to jump with the sledges. Here the ice broke up with some
of our sledges floating off on an island, stopping all progress
till we had lassoed some smaller cakes for ferries and on
these we rode over our remaining loads, finishing our night’s
work with hardly half a mile gained and everyone knocked
out again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>So for the next four days we struggled along, sometimes
making a mile a day; once, by great good luck, a mile and
a quarter. The going got worse. Pools of water from the
late rain gathered beneath the crusts of snow and thin
refrozen ice. As we came along, the surfaces broke beneath
us, leaving us to flounder to our knees through slush and ice
water. More sledge runners broke; Nindemann and Sweetman
were kept busy at all hours repairing them. Chipp got
worse, Alexey vomited at the slightest provocation, Lauterbach
looked ready to die, and Lee staggered along on his
weakened legs as if they were about to part company at
his damaged hips. Danenhower, of all those sick, while he
could hardly see, at least had some strength, and was added
to the hospital sled to help pull it under Chipp’s pilotage.
Ahead Dunbar scouted and marked out our road south by
compass, then with a pick-ax endeavored to clear interfering
hummocks from that path, aided a little in that by Newcomb.
I bossed the sledge gangs and kept them moving,
putting my shoulders beneath a boat or a sledge when necessary
to get it started. Ambler when not tending his patients,
armed with another pick-ax helped Dunbar clear the chosen
road. And bringing up the rear was De Long, supervising
the loading, checking food issues, and relentlessly driving
us all along.</p>

<p>On June 25, we had been underway eight days since
starting south. By such grueling labor over that pack as men
cannot ordinarily be driven to, even to save their own lives,
and which in this case only the overpowering will of De
Long rendered possible, we had made good to the southward
by my most liberal calculation a total distance over the ice
of five and one-half miles. I contemplated the result with
a leaden heart. Even should the ice extend southward only
one hundred miles out of the five hundred we had to cover
(which seemed far too good to be true), at that rate of advance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
it would take us one hundred and fifty days to cross
to open water. Long before that, unless we died of exhaustion
first as now looked very probable, our sixty days’ rations
would have been consumed and we should be left to perish
of starvation midway of the pack.</p>

<p>In despair, I gazed at our three cumbersome boats, overhanging
at both ends their heavy sledges, the last of which
after soul-wrenching efforts my party had just dragged over
rough hummocks into camp. Around it the men, too exhausted
even to go to their tents, were leaning their weary
bodies for a moment’s rest before they undertook the labor
of lifting again their aching and frozen feet. Those massive
boats, like millstones round our necks, were what were
killing our chances. With our food alone, divided into reasonable
sledge loads, we might make speed enough to escape,
but with those boats—! Incapable of division, the smallest
over a ton in weight, the largest over a ton and a half, dragging
those boats was like dragging huge anchors over the
floes. If only we could abandon them! But with a sigh, I
gave up that dream. With an open sea somewhere ahead,
the boats were as necessary to us as the pemmican. But only
five and a half miles made good in our first week when we
were strongest! It looked hopeless. We could only labor onward
and pray for a miracle. I quit thinking and turned
toward my tent, my supper, and my sleeping bag.</p>

<p>On the way, I bumped into Mr. Dunbar, just returning
from a preliminary scouting trip over our next night’s route.
Dunbar, hardly fifty, hale and hearty, a fine example of a
seasoned Yankee skipper when first he joined us, now with
his face wrinkled and worn, looked like a wizened old man
staggering under a burden of eighty years at least, and ready
to drop in his tracks at the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>“Well, captain,” I sang out jocularly to cheer him up a
bit, “what’s the good word from the front? Sighted that open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
water we’re looking for yet?”</p>

<p>The whaler looked at me with dulled eyes, then to my
astonishment broke down and sobbed on my shoulder like
a baby. I put a fur-clad arm gently round his heaving waist
to comfort him.</p>

<p>“What is it, old shipmate? Can’t you stand my jokes
either?”</p>

<p>“Chief,” he sobbed, “ye know it ain’t that; I like everything
about ye. But that ice ahead of us! It’s terrifically wild
and broken, and so chock-full o’ holes, chief, I could hardly
crawl across! We’ll never get our sledges over it!” The
weeping old seaman sagged down in my arms, his gray head
nestling in my beard.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so sure, mate,” I said with a cheeriness I didn’t
feel. “My lads are getting so expert heaving sledges over
hummocks, I’m thinking of putting ’em on as a flying trapeze
act in Barnum’s Circus when we get back, and making us
all as rich as Commodore Vanderbilt in one season! Come
on, captain, forget it; let’s have a cup of coffee to warm us
up—no, let’s belay the coffee. Come to think of it, I guess
I still got drag enough with Dr. Ambler to work him for a
shot of whiskey apiece for a couple of good old salts like us.”
And I led him away to the hospital tent, where Ambler,
after one look at Dunbar, hardly needed the wink from me
to produce without a word his medical whiskey.</p>

<p>Leaving Dunbar with the doctor after swallowing a drink
myself, I started again for my own tent, but once more I
was stopped, by the captain this time, who beckoned me
to join him in the snow alongside the deserted whaleboat.
All hands were in their tents by now, working on their
cold pemmican.</p>

<p>“What have you made our mileage to the south so far,
chief?” opened the skipper listlessly.</p>

<p>“Being generous, about five and a half miles, sir.” I looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
at him puzzled. The captain knew our progress, logged daily
in his journal, even better than I. Surely he wasn’t keeping
me from my supper just for that.</p>

<p>De Long nodded, continued,</p>

<p>“That’s right, over the ice of course. Melville, I’m sorry
to say that today I got some good sights of the sun for the
first time since we started. Chief,” and his voice broke as he
looked at me, “the northwest drift has got us! We’re twenty-five

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Twenty-five miles further north than when we started!
Coming on top of all else, that was a knockout blow. With
sagging knees, I leaned against the gunwale of the whaleboat,
looked at the haggard captain, asked faintly,</p>

<p>“Sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied mournfully, “sure. Two meridian altitudes
of the sun and a couple of Sumner lines and they all
check. I couldn’t believe the first sight myself; I thought my
sextant was bad. But after checking that with nothing wrong,
I spent all day getting check sights; you saw me shooting
some of them. No question about it now. But, for God’s
sake, don’t tell anyone! Not even another officer. If the men
knew, I couldn’t get ’em to lay a hand on another sledge.
They’d just sit down here and wait to die!”</p>

<p>I nodded at that. Who could blame them? Caught on a
treadmill, why should they torture themselves with such
labor as slaves would lie down under and suffer themselves
to be lashed to death rather than rise and endure, when
the only result was that they were being carried backward
five times as fast as their puny efforts pushed them forward?
If the men learned the results of those disastrous sights, we
were finished! But weren’t we finished anyway, whether they
knew it or not?</p>

<p>“That’s bad, captain,” I mumbled, my brain numbed at
the news. “What can we do now?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t figured it out fully yet, chief; I want your advice
on what I have in mind. That’s the only reason I told
you; that, and maybe the thought that at least one other
officer ought to know where we are and where we’re going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
in case something happens to me. Since Chipp and Danenhower,
both my deck officers, are knocked out, you’re the
only officer left I can talk to. But this mustn’t get out! It’d
kill Chipp, who’s in a bad way anyhow, like hitting him with
an ax. And what it’d do to the men, you can guess!” He finished
with a ghastly smile.</p>

<p>Vaguely I felt that that might be a mercy to Chipp; indeed
it might well be a mercy to all of us should a kindly
Providence then and there somehow brain us all with an
ax and end our sufferings. But of that I said nothing. The
captain had hinted at something further to be done. What,
I wondered, was it? Abandon the boats, speed up our progress,
trusting to luck the ice held out under us till we got
to the New Siberian Islands, there to live (or starve rather)
on moss and Arctic willow till perhaps some year a chance
party of ivory hunters landed and rescued us? A thin chance,
that! I looked curiously at De Long.</p>

<p>“Well, skipper, no thanks for telling me. I could’ve got
more work out of my gang if I were still in blissful ignorance
like the others than I can now, but I’ll keep on doing
my best. And if my advice is any good, you’re welcome to
it. What’s your idea?”</p>

<p>“I know that well enough, chief. I would gladly have
suffered under that knowledge alone, but the safety of the
whole party requires someone else to know, and unfortunately
to suffer with me. But no use talking about that now.
Let’s get along with what’s next.” He jerked out from beneath
his parka a chart, unfolded it, spread it on the midship
thwart of the whaleboat. On it, marked by a bold cross enclosed
in a red ink circle, was a spot in latitude 77° 18′ N.
where the <em>Jeannette</em> had sunk, a spot unfortunately for us
now, far to the southeast of the small penciled cross in latitude
77° 43′ N. which marked our present position as shown
by the captain’s latest sights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>“There’s just one possible thing we can do, Melville;
change the course from due south as we’re heading now, to
southwest. The ice is drifting clearly enough northwest. It’s
like crossing a river current; no use bucking into it as we’re
doing now going south, even if land is closest that way. The
only hope is to cut across perpendicular to the current and
ultimately you get to the other bank, even though the current
carries you downstream meanwhile. The same with us,
we’ve got to cut directly across the drift, that is, southwest;
and some day, regardless of how far north we’re carried,
we’ll come to the edge of this pack and can launch
our boats—provided we live long enough! And to insure
that, we’re going to go on shorter rations now to stretch
out our food,” he concluded significantly. “I’ve decided all
that already, Melville. All I want to know from you—you’re
working the men—is how thin I can cut it and still let you
keep on driving them, harder even than now!”</p>

<p>I thought a moment. Our daily rations, pemmican, hard
bread, and coffee, were none too generous in quantity as
it was for the terrific physical effort the men were laboring
under. But who knows what men can stand? I was learning
all the time.</p>

<p>“Well, skipper, cut a third off. That’ll stretch it out for
ninety days instead of sixty. I doubt that we can keep up
long on such short rations, but maybe we can knock over a
few seals to help out now and then. Anyhow, I’m willing to
try.</p>

<p>“Good!” agreed De Long. “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nil desperandum!</i> I knew I
could count fully on you, chief; I always can. We’ll start
that program, new course and all, tonight.” He started to
fold up the chart again, when his eye fell on the penciled
cross marking our position. “77° 43′ North,” he muttered.
“Farthest North for us yet. And forever too, on this cruise
anyway, I hope. Say, Melville, you remember that silk banner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
you used in claiming Henrietta Island? Well, it’s in the
first cutter, alongside the whaleboat here. There’s something
else about that flag my wife made for me. She wanted me to
fly it in celebration when we made our ‘Farthest North.’
Let’s hope we’re celebrating that glad event right here and
now. But the crew knows about that too, I think. If I fly
<em>that</em> flag over this camp, they’ll smell a rat right off.” He
looked furtively round. All our men were apparently still
in the tents. No one was in sight. “I think I can take a
chance to please Mrs. De Long on this; it’s little enough
I’ve done for her since she married a sailor. Here, Melville,
lend a hand.”</p>

<p>Together we drew from its case and unwrapped that
silken banner, a moderately large American ensign beautifully
embroidered round the edges by Emma De Long’s loving
hands for her husband’s ship. And stealthily, keeping it below
the gunwales of the first cutter lest someone looking from
a tent should see and wonder, we fully extended it horizontally.
Then standing on the ice alongside that open boat,
with De Long to starboard and me to port, we two, looking
certain death on the pack in the face, waved that banner
beneath the Arctic sky in latitude 77° 43′ from the Equator—Farthest
North for George Washington De Long, if not for
the <em>Jeannette</em>!</p>

<p>And then, leaning over the gunwale, De Long buried his
weather-beaten face in the rustling silk folds of his wife’s
flag, kissing it fervently, while I, clinging to the other side,
closed my wet eyes in silence. Well did I remember that
June day in 1879, almost exactly two years before in San
Francisco, when at our commissioning Emma De Long, a
lovely figure, had herself proudly manned the halliards and
hoisted that banner to the masthead on the <em>Jeannette</em>! But
the <em>Jeannette</em> was gone beneath the floes, and far away at
that moment, I envisioned Emma De Long, a different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
woman now, worn by two years of hourly dread over news
that never came, praying for the safety of the man before
me, who with heaving shoulders was caressing his country’s
flag, the solitary symbol of his wife’s love still left in his
possession.</p>

<p>De Long straightened up.</p>

<p>“All right, Melville. I think my wife’ll be glad to know
when it gets back we flew her flag at our Farthest North.
Come on, let’s fold it up; carefully now, so nobody’ll know
we had it out and perhaps guess why.”</p>

<p>Silently I obeyed. We rolled up the flag, slid it into its
oilskin case, carefully restowed the case as before. The
chances of our ever getting back were slight now, but as I
shoved that case under the thwarts in the cutter, bachelor
as I was, I hoped that even though our own bodies might
soon be stretched in death over that desolate ice pack, somehow
that flag in the boat might survive the drift, some day
to be picked up and returned to the one person who would
sense among its silken folds the message that it bore.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">When we got underway that night on June 25th, we headed
southwest instead of south. Burning in my breast were De
Long’s words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nil desperandum!</i> and my faith in him from
his faith in me, rose. The ice to the southwest, thank God,
Dunbar reported as not so bad as he had found it to the
south, though Heaven knows how that could have been for
we had to bridge and ferry five times in one mile, and in
many places to get our sledges over inescapable hummocks
blocking our path, we had to build inclined planes of snow
to their crests and other inclines down the lee slopes, then
heave our sledges up one slope like Egyptian slaves building
the Pyramids, and brace ourselves back to ease them down
the other side. We couldn’t even coast down the lee slopes,
for then the sledges buried their noses so deeply in the banks
at the bottom that extricating them was horrible work.</p>

<p>So like horses (though sometimes seahorses as we plowed
through water to our waists) we worked along through the
ensuing week, making about a mile and a half a day over the
ice. We were all in a bad way from exhaustion, and oddly
enough the brilliant sun, cold though it was around 28° F.,
burned and blistered our faces and added to our general suffering.
On top of that a mental trouble became noticeable;
the men were grumbling because no news of our position
or of our progress had been posted, for they had all seen the
captain taking sights and felt that the results ought to be
made known. As the week drew along and nothing was
said, they began to get suspicious, but none dared ask the
captain; when they questioned me, I merely shrugged my
shoulders, saying,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t ask me, boys. I’m only an engineer! Why should
I bother with the navigation?”</p>

<p>As for the growling which was plentiful over the shortened
rations, I could point out that our progress was slower than
originally expected so we must naturally stint ourselves to
stretch them out longer, and thus allayed any suspicion on
that score.</p>

<p>But De Long had a busy time dodging his other officers,
lest they ask embarrassing questions. With Chipp and Danenhower
this was not difficult, for Chipp could hardly walk
and Danenhower could hardly see. Keeping away from them
was easy. Ducking Dunbar was much harder, but since the
ice-pilot was ahead laying out the road most of the night,
the skipper with some finesse managed to steer the discussions
into safer channels on the few occasions when he couldn’t
avoid him. Ambler, however, turned out to be a Tartar who
from the very nature of his duties the captain couldn’t keep
away from. Finally, concluding that with Ambler confidence
was better than suspicion, he acquainted him also with the
reasons for our sudden change of course, and I must say
for the doctor that I think he took it better than I did, for
early in the week when he was told, he was more than
having his hands full between swinging a pick-ax on the
roads and tending his patients, especially Chipp.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Chipp, carried from his sick bed when the
ship sank, was in a bad way from exposure and sleeping on
the ice, despite the fact that he was the only person allowed
to take an extra coat. Even the week’s rest before we started
sledging south helped him little and he fainted in his harness
the first day out. After that, though hauling no longer on
the hospital sledge, he had since barely managed to stagger
along with it as it went.</p>

<p>The day we started southwest, so badly off was Chipp
that slow as we went that day, he could not hobble well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
enough to keep his emaciated and pain-racked body up with
the hospital sledge and was delaying even its snail-like progress.
De Long, bringing up the rear guard, ordered him to
climb aboard the sledge and ride. Chipp made no move to
get aboard, but instead staggered onward. Without a word,
De Long picked him off the ice, laid him gently on his
back on the sledge, and ordered briefly,</p>

<p>“You stay there, Chipp, or I’ll hand you a courtmartial
for insubordination! You’re delaying our progress when you
walk!”</p>

<p>Poor Chipp, broken-hearted at being made a burden for
his overladen shipmates to drag, tried to roll off the sledge
to the snow, but so weak was he that he could do no more
than turn on his face when he stuck, clawing feebly, trying
to pull himself off the sledge. Failing even in that, he looked
pitifully up at De Long by his side.</p>

<p>“Don’t make them drag me, captain, please! I’m all gone
anyway. Take me off!” he begged. “You’d better leave me
behind right here!”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Chipp,” ordered De Long abruptly. “You’ll
do what I say like everybody else in this outfit! Quit worrying;
you’re going to get better. But better or worse, nobody
gets left behind while there’s a man alive able to drag him
along!”</p>

<p>He motioned to Lauterbach, Alexey, and Danenhower,
dragging the sledge.</p>

<p>“Get underway now, men. I’ll help you till I can send
someone else.” And with the captain pushing and the others
pulling, the sledge started again with the enfeebled Chipp
face down on the load, scarcely able to cling to the lashings,
weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>We got along. But I might here mention that for every
mile of progress over the ice that we made, we had to walk
thirteen miles! To advance a boat sledge took the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
working party together; to advance a provision sledge half
loaded took half the party, so to get our three boats and
four provision sledges (the dogs handled the other one)
along one mile meant that seven times under load and six
times empty-handed, thirteen times in all, the staggering
working party had to traverse that mile of ice. If the edge
of the pack should by God’s grace turn out to be no further
than a hundred miles from our starting point, still when we
reached it we should have tramped thirteen hundred miles
over that terrible ice, seven hundred of those miles dragging
inhuman loads! If it were twice as far—God help us then!</p>

<p>So we went along, over what Jack Cole, ruefully tugging
in the lead harness, called,</p>

<p>“’Tis the rocky road to Dublin, me byes. Yo heave!
Shure an’ we should be nearly there by mornin’!” But I
knew it would be many a morning yet, if ever, ere Jack
raised Dublin or anything like it over that ice horizon.</p>

<p>July 3rd arrived with good enough weather for the captain
to get another set of observations of the sun, which on working
out, he communicated to me. The new position was in
latitude 77° 31′ N., longitude 150° 41′ E., which was to some
degree gratifying, for while it was still thirteen miles north
of where we left the <em>Jeannette</em>, it was thirteen miles generally
southwest of where we were on June 25th, and checked very
well with both the course we had been steering and our distance
logged over the ice since then, twelve miles. This was
cheering, for it seemed to indicate no ice drift at all for the
last eight days, and things began to look up. Only thirteen
miles more and we would be as far south as when we started
sixteen days before! Naturally, while all this cheered De
Long, Ambler and myself, the knowledge would have cheered
nobody else, so no notice of it was posted and no mention
made.</p>

<p>July 4th we celebrated on the ice, without any fireworks or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
speeches, simply breaking out our small boat flags (the woolen
ones only) and, so to speak, dressing ship. De Long was excessively
blue all day, for it was the third anniversary of the
day in Le Havre, France, when Miss Bennett had christened
his ship with her name, <em>Jeannette</em>, and he had listened to many
glowing speeches of what was expected of her. Looking at
the three small boats which were all that was left of his
command made De Long decidedly sick. Had there been
only the safety of himself to consider the day his ship went
down, I am sure De Long would have gone down with her.</p>

<p>By way of a feast in honor of the day we had our usual
short allowance of cold pemmican which we ate thankfully.
I may say here that pemmican (which is a mixture made of
beef pounded more or less to a powder, mixed with raisins,
and then the whole stirred up in boiling fat which when
cold is packed in cans) while a highly nutritious and palatable
food served in cold slices which we ate like cake, as a
steady diet gets infernally tiresome. Alexey on this day, with
a naive faith in the white man’s powers, feeling that a holiday
called for something better, in all seriousness told the
doctor that he would take mutton instead!</p>

<p>At this, Lee, my machinist, who was also in the doctor’s
tent, very gravely informed the doctor of the best way to
make Rhode Island clam chowder, which he felt was the
only proper dish for any July 4th banquet, and the poor
doctor, with all this gastronomical advice bringing back recollections
of past Independence Day feasts back in old Virginia
garnished with everything from savory baked hams to candied
sweet potatoes, found his mouth watering so that he lost
all interest in his cold pemmican and fled from the tent.</p>

<p>Underway again that evening, we stumbled along as before,
heaving, holding back, building ice bridges, ferrying on
bobbing floes across the water leads when we did not fall
into them. De Long, his mind a little relieved about the drift,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
spent fewer hours in the rear and most of the night tramping
over our route, for the first time beginning to take some notice
of individuals and what they were doing. Coming up to one
bridging job, where I had a piece of floating ice jammed
into a crack some fifteen feet wide while the crew were
dragging sledges across it to the southern side, he noticed
that Collins, standing at the edge of the gap, was holding the
line securing the makeshift bridge in place.</p>

<p>“Mr. Collins,” said the captain icily, “you have many times
in disrespectful language informed me that you didn’t ship
to be treated as a seaman. I can’t allow you to go home, claiming
that I forced you to work as one even to save your own
life. Give that rope to one of the men!”</p>

<p>Collins made no move to obey. Instead for perhaps half a
minute he stood glaring like a tiger at De Long, till the latter,
noting Seaman Dressler close alongside, sternly ordered,</p>

<p>“Mr. Collins, give that rope to Dressler, and don’t let me
catch you putting your hand to another line until I order
you! You are still under suspension awaiting trial and don’t
you forget it!”</p>

<p>Collins, ready to burst with anger, slowly passed over the
line and without a word dropped to the rear.</p>

<p>We moved along. Under the continued burning rays of
the sun, the snow melted and drained away from the surface,
making the going a little easier, and our consumption of food
lightened up our loads, still further aiding our speed, but our
personnel troubles increased.</p>

<p>Ambler was particularly burdened. Ten days of riding on
the sledge and careful medical attention had so built up Chipp
that he could walk again, and with that little improvement,
he began to nag the doctor to put him off the sicklist and restore
him to duty in command of one of the parties. Danenhower
also, his physique improved by the enforced exercise
he was getting in walking after his long confinement aboard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
ship, began to make the same demand, though he could
hardly see through his one heavily shielded eye. Ambler
naturally enough refused both requests. As a result, daily
when he came into his tent after having wielded a pick-ax all
night long on the roads, and crawled horribly tired into his
sleeping bag to rest, it was only to listen to his two blessed
invalids exchanging sneering remarks about his medical competence
because he would not restore them to duty. Finally,
unable to stand it further, he burst out,</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, shut up, both of you! Dan, if you’d
obeyed my orders on the ship, one of your eyes would be
well now! And you, Chipp, a little while ago were begging
us to leave you on the ice to die! Now that you’re both
barely able to get yourselves along, you want <em>me</em> to risk
other men’s lives by putting them in your charge, and I’ll
be damned if I will! Was ever a doctor cursed by two such
patients!”</p>

<p>But if his patients aggravated him, his helpers on the road
work tried his very soul. In charge of the road-building gang,
Ambler had as assistant laborers Lee and Newcomb, and to
draw along the sledge with the dinghy which was assigned to
him for working in the open leads, seven of such miserable,
broken-down dogs that they were worthless for any work
on the heavy sledges and only an irritation on his lighter one.
But even so, Ambler might philosophically have accepted the
situation and kept on as he was, doing most of the work with
a pick-ax himself, had it not been for Newcomb. For both
the broken-down dogs and Lee with his shaky legs were at
least doing their poor best. Quite to the contrary, our naturalist,
though fully recovered from his indisposition, infuriated
the doctor, himself manfully swinging a pick, by the piddling
efforts which he was pleased to pass off as work. Patiently
Ambler showed him how to swing a pick on the hummocks;
then getting no results from him, sharply ordered him to turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
to, only to find Newcomb more interested in pertly answering
back than in obeying. For two days Ambler, with his
southern temper slowly rising, stood it, merely remarking
grimly to me one night,</p>

<p>“If that Yankee chatterbox doesn’t soon do some work instead
of answering me back every time I speak to him, he’s
going to get some medical attention that’ll astonish him!”
I watched them working a little ahead of me that night as
I trod back and forth with the sledges. We had only two
pick-axes in our whole outfit. Newcomb, at the base of a
steep hummock, was using one ax in a pretense of picking at
it, while I could see Ambler, standing on its slippery crest,
nervously tightening his calloused hands about our other
pick-ax handle as if debating whether to swing then on Newcomb’s
head or wait till he was a little surer of his footing.
While the doctor was in this uncertain frame of mind, Newcomb
below him quit picking at the ice altogether, lashed a
line to his pick-ax to make it serve as an anchor for something
or other, and then, sad to relate, overboard into an
open water lead went the precious pick-ax, line and all, a
total loss!</p>

<p>In spite of the real tragedy which the loss of that pick-ax
meant to us, what happened next made me roar. Ambler’s
fingers closed firmly on the handle of our sole remaining ax,
apparently determined, poor as his shot now was, to swing
and make an end of the gadfly below him; then changing his
mind, he leaped from the hummock, stopped only a second to
wave the pick in Newcomb’s face while he bellowed,</p>

<p>“You bird-stuffing idiot! If I weren’t afraid of breaking our
last ax on your worthless skull, I’d kill you with it!” and
dropping the pick on the floe, he ran off to find the captain.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he was back, all smiles, to find Newcomb,
instead of manning the last ax, casually scanning the
sky for something really important—gulls perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>“It’s all fixed now, Mr. Newcomb,” said Ambler cheerfully.
“I offered the captain to trade you for another worthless
cur for my sledge, but he couldn’t find one poor enough
to make it a fair exchange, so bless his heart, he gave me Seaman
Johnson for my road gang and said I could do what I
pleased about you. So now you’re fired! Get out of here!”</p>

<p>Newcomb, pert as ever, enquired,</p>

<p>“Discharged, I presume you mean me to infer? How welcome!
What am I to do now?”</p>

<p>“Tie your shotgun round your neck for ballast and jump
after that pick-ax, if you want to do me a favor!” advised the
doctor, fingering the last pick significantly. “Now get out of
my way while I work, or there may yet happen what will
go down in the log as a most regrettable accident!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">De Long was left with the problem of how to make Collins
and Newcomb useful members of our primitive community.
While Collins, before the captain noticed him, had done useful
work when it suited him to help, I have little doubt that
it was only for the Machiavellian purpose of building up a
brutal mistreatment case against the captain. Had he been
ordered to work steadily in harness like the others, he would
either have flatly balked or else have done it only as a martyr,
neither of which situations the captain was prepared to cope
with. Newcomb’s case was a little different. Had he been my
problem, I am confident that the toe of my boot, properly
applied a few times, would have startlingly changed his outlook
both on work and on keeping his mouth shut when
spoken to, but De Long was constitutionally opposed to
physical persuasion. Casting his eye about the floes, the skipper
observed that seals were again occasionally in evidence,
and decided that since both our Indians, Alexey and Aneguin,
were laboring like all the others as pack-horses, he might well
substitute Collins and Newcomb for them as hunters. Hunting
being in all civilized circles a gentleman’s privilege, neither
of these pseudo-seamen officers could well maintain that it
was beneath the stations for which they had shipped, and if
they shot anything, it would be of real value in stretching out
our precious food supply, let alone giving us a change from
the pemmican which constituted the fish, flesh, fowl and
vegetable of our unvaried menu.</p>

<p>So promptly providing Collins with a rifle and Newcomb
with the shotgun which he had carried from the wreck, both
were turned to on the floes to see what they could do in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
earning their passage while our straggling line of boats and
sledges moved on over the pack.</p>

<p>But even so Collins was not satisfied. A member of the
party messing and sleeping in the captain’s tent, his main
business in life seemed to be sizing up what he could find
wrong with De Long’s management of the retreat, to add in
his private notes to whatever else he had accumulated in the
way of (in his eyes) errors in the captain’s judgment. But he
must have had a tough time of it, for the only thing that
apparently displeased him now was as he related it to his
<em>confidant</em>, Bartlett,</p>

<p>“The skipper’s always too infernally polite to me, seeing
that I’m served before he helps himself to pemmican, and
making sure my place in the tent’s all right before he’ll crawl
into his sleeping bag.”</p>

<p>And under these embarrassing conditions, Collins began his
life as a hunter.</p>

<p>July 10th, far to the southwest, Dunbar sighted a faint
cloud which he announced as land, gravely assuring us that
the New Siberian Islands were in sight. While the skipper
was dubious of its being land at all, knowing (what Dunbar
and most of the party did not) that the nearest charted land,
those New Siberian Islands, were still a hundred and twenty
miles off, so that what was seen was either a mirage or a new
discovery, the effect on our progress was magical—over none
too good ice we made three and a quarter miles that day! In
the clearer atmosphere, the skipper got some sights for the
first time in a week which when worked out placed us in latitude
77° 8′ N., longitude 151° 38′ E., to our joy showing
that at last we were south of 77° 18′ N. from which we had
started. But both the skipper and I stared in amazement at our
new position, for having by dead reckoning and compass
made sixteen miles to the south<em>west</em> over the pack during the
week, the sights showed that our actual change of position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
in those seven days was twenty-seven miles to the south<em>east</em>.
So once again the current had us, carrying us where it would,
but since this time it was increasing our southing, we could
only be thoroughly grateful.</p>

<p>That night when (still keeping our actual position a secret)
it was announced that not only were we doing well over the
ice, but that a southerly drift was helping us along, there was
a roaring cheer as the straining men in harness leaned forward,
and we got the boats away in grand style.</p>

<p>For two weeks we struggled on to the southwest, sometimes
certain we saw land, sometimes certain we didn’t. But it was
discouraging work. Fog, snow, and hail made our lives miserable,
and between the everlasting ferrying over open leads
and the plowing through pools of surface slush, we kept our
clothes continuously soaked in ice water. Aside from the discomfort
of stretching out in wet clothes to sleep in a wet bag
on a rubber sheet sunk in a puddle on wet ice, the interminable
wetness began to finish our moccasin and boot-soles, and
now there wasn’t a tight pair left in the ship’s company. These
soles, made of “oog-joog” skin, a rawhide from a species of
seal, were fine when dry in ordinary snow or ice, but when
wet, they softened to resemble tripe and then under the
strain of men heaving hard against sharp ice with their feet
to drag the sledges, they soon let go. As long as the spare
“oog-joog” brought from the <em>Jeannette</em> held out, we patched
away till all hands stood on a mass of patches as they worked,
but when it gave out (and it very soon did), we were in a
bad way for substitutes. First we tried leather, stripping it
from the oar-looms, but leather was not only too hard and
slippery for use on the ice but our supply didn’t last long,
and we were quickly reduced to canvas, to sennet mats woven
of hemp rope by the seamen, to rag mats, and even to wooden
soles carved from what little planking our carpenter could
strip out of the bottom boards in our boats. None were in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
degree satisfactory—one hard heave on sharp ice would often
tear the soles off a man’s boots—and frequently before the
end of a night’s hauling I would have half a dozen men straining
at the sledges with their bare feet on the ice, even their
socks completely worn through, while the rest of the gang,
whose soles still clung on, would be spurting a mixture of
slush and water from their torn moccasins at each step.</p>

<p>Between the lodestone effect of the dim land ahead of us,
less snow, a little smoother ice, and lighter sledges, we speeded
up. The ice improved to the point where we could drag a
boat with only half our party, thus advancing two loads at
once and having to tramp only seven miles for each mile
made, instead of thirteen as before. But the cracks in the ice
increased in frequency and ferrying and bridging over them
made our lives a nightmare, the mental strain of forever riding
heavy sledges over bobbing ice cakes which threatened
to capsize each instant, being indescribable. And to add to our
worries, our dogs began to get fits, four of our best ones
spinning dizzily in their harnesses before dropping on the
ice, frothing at the mouth when we cut them out of the
traces.</p>

<p>One pleasing incident occurred amidst all our hardships.
After ten days of hunting, Collins finally shot a seal in an
open lead, which prize was handsomely recovered by Ambler
and Johnson in the dinghy before it sank. For this we were
doubly thankful—after using his grease to tighten up our
leaking boots, we dined most luxuriously on stewed seal, fried
seal, and if only we had had an oven, we might have had
roast seal. But he went very well as it was; after a month on
cold pemmican, it was a feast long to be remembered!</p>

<p>July 16th we struck tough going. The ferrying grew worse
than ever; Erichsen crossing a lead capsized with his sledge
and we lost three hundred pounds of pemmican, a serious
blow. A few minutes later, trying to get to a high hummock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
to inspect the distant land now more visible ahead. De Long
tried to jump a wide lead, the ice broke under him and he
went in up to his neck. He might well have gone completely
and forever had not Dunbar, who was with him, at that point
grabbed him by what he thought was his fur hood but which
was actually his whiskers, and nearly jerked the skipper’s
head off pulling him out by his mustaches!</p>

<p>Finally on this day, the doctor discharged Chipp from the
sicklist, though doubtful as to how long it might be before
Chipp broke down again. This resulted in a shuffle in commands—Chipp
relieved me in charge of the working force;
I relieved Ambler in charge of the road gang; and Ambler
with only Danenhower left as a regular patient, was detailed
to work with Dunbar in scouting out the road. The doctor
offered to join the sledge gang in harness, but we were
doing better there, so the skipper refused. He preferred to
use Ambler simply as scout and medical officer, hoping that
his terribly calloused, corned, and chapped hands might recover
enough for proper surgical work should an accident
make any necessary.</p>

<p>The skipper worked out some sights. The latitude, reliable,
was 76° 41′ N.—28 miles gained to the south in six days—fine
progress, much more than we were logging over the ice. The
longitude, doubtful, put us at 153° 30′ E., indicating we were
still going southeast though we were heading southwest, but
we were not greatly concerned over that. Anything to the
south was cause for gratitude.</p>

<p>We dragged along five days more. Newcomb at last shot
something, a gull he called a <em>mollemokki</em>, interesting ornithologically
to him, perhaps, worthless to us for food, certainly.
The ice grew rotten; we had more trouble with it.
Our men, their eyes and minds affected by the ice, easily
deluded by mirages, were now seeing land in nearly all directions,
south of us, west of us, and even <em>north</em> of us! And not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
day went by when someone didn’t see open water ahead of us,
fine wide-open sea in which we could launch our boats, toss
away our sledges, and sail homeward in comfort!</p>

<p>Instead of that we soon bumped into the worst mess of ice
we had yet encountered, a jumble of small lumps and water,
with numberless large floes tipped on end vertically. With
my road gang and our solitary pick-ax, I started the herculean
job of clearing away some of these hummocks so we might
proceed, and was busily at it when the doctor, bless his soul,
came in to report that by retracing our path northward half
a mile, we could then go due west till we got on the flank of
that broken ice, after which we might go southwest again. I
snapped at that; the job ahead of me was like tunneling
through a mountain with a toothpick. So back over our trail
we went with our boats and sledges.</p>

<p>Getting across even that better path was a heartrending job,
for the rotten floes would hardly stick alongside each other,
till finally using all the lines we had, like Alpine climbers we
lashed the floes together while we crossed over, seriously
hampered by a dense fog. It was a long stretch. In the middle
of it, we came to morning, our usual time for piping down to
camp and rest during the day, but the captain, seriously
alarmed at the prospect of that rotten and moving ice disintegrating
under us while we slept, belayed the usual camp. So
without rest and only a brief stop for supper, we kept on, till
after twenty-three hours of terrific labor we came in the late
afternoon to a solider floe and stopped at last to rest our weary
bones.</p>

<p>The captain, feeling rightly enough that what we now
most sorely needed was sleep rather than cold supper, gave
the order for all hands to turn in. This the men in my tent
thankfully did and were soon stretched out in their sleeping
bags, but in the next tent, assigned to Danenhower, Newcomb,
and five seamen, Newcomb immediately sounded off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>“This is a fine way,” he said sarcastically, “to treat men who
have been working so hard; ordering them to turn in without
anything to eat!”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Danenhower peered in surprise through his
dark glasses at the naturalist who had done nothing all day
but carry a small shotgun.</p>

<p>“Maybe it <em>is</em> hard for the men who are working, Newcomb,”
he said quietly, “but for you and me who haven’t
done a blessed thing, it isn’t, and we shouldn’t be the first to
complain now.”</p>

<p>Newcomb ran true to form. Instead of taking the hint thus
delicately conveyed, he retorted angrily,</p>

<p>“I wasn’t speaking to you; I was speaking to these men. I
don’t count myself in the same category with you. I’m a
worker!”</p>

<p>Newcomb a worker! Danenhower could hardly believe his
ears. But not wishing to start a row before the men, and not
wanting anyone, least of all a man who passed as an officer
with them, to encourage them in the belief that they were
ill-treated, he ordered curtly,</p>

<p>“Pipe down, Newcomb! That’s enough on that!”</p>

<p>But piping down was one thing not in Newcomb’s psychology.
Answering back suited him better.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t!” he piped up. “I don’t take orders from
you. And now that the crisis has come, I’m going to meet the
issue! You’ve made yourself disagreeable to me right along,
but I’m an officer too, and it’s got to stop!”</p>

<p>Had Dan been able to see in more than a vague blur, the
issue would undoubtedly have met Newcomb’s jaw then and
there. As it was, without further words, Dan stumbled from
the tent to report the still spouting naturalist to the captain
for endeavoring to foment trouble in the crew.</p>

<p>In five minutes, Newcomb was placed under arrest to be
taken home for courtmartial on two charges:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I. Using language tending to produce discontent among
the men; and</p>

<p>II. When remonstrated with by Lieutenant Danenhower,
using insolent and insubordinate language.</p>
</div>

<p>There being little further De Long could then do, he deprived
Newcomb of his shotgun, ordered him to keep in the
rear as we proceeded, and sternly warned him meantime not
to annoy anyone working.</p>

<p>So when late that night we got underway, we had two
officers under arrest—the surly Collins who seemed to spend
much of his time unburdening his wrongs in the ears of my
fireman Bartlett, but in between times making himself useful
as a hunter, and Newcomb who was thoroughly useless for
anything.</p>

<p>The land which Dunbar weeks before had sighted across
the ice, undoubtedly a newly discovered island not on the
charts, was now in plain sight only a few miles off, bearing
westward. Through bad gales and over broken pack, with
occasional floebergs suddenly shooting into the air near us,
we worked toward it. July 23rd, the captain’s sights showed
no change in our latitude since the 16th; in that time between
our own efforts and the erratic drift, we had been taken
twenty-eight miles due west and were now fairly close to
our new island. We struggled along toward it over badly
moving ice, but at least this ice was firm and many of the
floes were large. Collins finally shot another seal, but it sank
before the dinghy could get to it, and we sadly saw our visions
of a second feast dissolve into cold water. Next morning we
pitched camp as usual, with the land tantalizing us not three
miles off but mostly hidden in fog. Soon after turning in, the
man on watch shouted,</p>

<p>“Bear!” and instantly out of their sleeping bags popped
Alexey and Aneguin, eager to get the first bear sighted since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
our ship sank. We heard a couple of shots, and our mouths
began to water. Um-m! Bear steaks for dinner! But it was all
wasted for soon the two Indians were back, empty-handed
and disgusted. The bear had been in such excellent trim that
they had had to fire at a thousand yards on a rapidly reciprocating
target as that bear humped himself over the ice, and
they had of course missed. However, it didn’t matter much,
claimed Alexey, as the bear was only a dirty brown one and
not very big, a remark which prompted the captain to ask
innocently,</p>

<p>“Sour grapes, Alexey?” but Alexey only looked at him
puzzled. Grapes, sour or otherwise, never grew in his latitudes,
so I’m afraid he missed the point. Quieting our disappointed
stomachs as best we could, once more we turned in.
But we got the bear. In the late afternoon, Seaman Görtz,
who had the watch the while the rest of us slept, spotted him
once again. This time Görtz kept his mouth shut while the
bear advanced to within five hundred yards of our camp, and
then, unnoticed, our lookout managed to crawl within a hundred
yards of him to plant two bullets in that bear where they
did the most good!</p>

<p>Now that we had him, he turned out to be a very fine bear
indeed, even Alexey admitting that ungrudgingly, and soon
the air over that floe was filled with an appetizing aroma of
sizzling bear steaks that fairly intoxicated us. We envied no
man on earth his evening meal that night as, disdaining pemmican,
we gorged ourselves on bear. But we needed it. When
we broke camp and started for the island ahead, we found
ourselves with nothing but moving ice over which to work
our sledges.</p>

<p>For two days, mostly in fog, we fought our way toward
that island, with the floes breaking under us, sliding away
from us, and the whole pack alive around us. A gale blew up,
and on the off side of the hummocks about us, a bad surf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
broke and kept us drenched. Finally on the third day, we
found ourselves opposite the dimly visible western tip of the
island, with nothing but a forlorn chance left of ever making
the solid ground that so desperately we ached to rest ourselves
on. With but a few hundred yards remaining before
the pack finally drifted us past it forever, we sighted ahead a
long floe of heavy blue ice extending in toward the land, with
only a few openings between the floe and ours. We bridged
the gaps, bounced our sledges and boats over, and made good
a mile and a half across that floe. There we found more
broken ice and water, which with difficulty we started to
cross in the fog by passing a line to a floe beyond and using
a smaller cake as a ferryboat, when suddenly the fog lifted
and there over our heads, some 2500 feet high, towered a
huge cliff, and sweeping past it as in a millrace were the
floes on which we rode!</p>

<p>We finished our ferry, ending on a moderate-sized floe
drifting rapidly past the fixed ice piled up at the base of the
cliff, with the southwest cape, our last slim chance to make
the land, not far off. For over two weeks we had dragged
and struggled toward that island; now in despair we found
ourselves being helplessly swept by it!</p>

<p>Our little floe, covered with sledges, men and dogs, whirled
and eddied in the race, spinning crazily, and threatening to
break up any moment, when we noted that if only it should
make the next spin in the right direction, it might touch a
corner against the ice fringing the land. We waited breathlessly.
It did!</p>

<p>“Away, Chipp!” shouted De Long, and in an instant our
sledges started to move off that spinning floe. The first got
away perfectly, the second nearly went overboard, the third
sledge shot into the sea, carrying Cole with it, and the fourth
was only saved by Erichsen who, with superhuman strength,
shoved an ice cake in for a bridge. We couldn’t get the boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
sledges over; our floe was already starting to crack up. Working
frenziedly as it broke, the few of us left on the floe
pushed the boats, their sledges still under them, off into the
water and the men already landed started to haul the boats
over to them, when away drifted the last remnant of that
ice cake, carrying with it De Long, Iversen, Aneguin and me,
together with six dogs! For a few minutes we were in a bad
way, threatening to drift clear of the island on that tiny ice
cake with no food, except perhaps the dogs; while the men
ashore ran wildly along the ice-foot, unable to help us in
any manner.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, a little further along a swirl drove our
floe in against a grounded berg for a second and dogs and all,
we made a wild leap for it; successfully too, for only three of
us landed in the water. Aneguin, the Indian, proved the best
broad jumper. He landed safely enough on the berg and
dragged the rest of us up and out.</p>

<p>Soon reunited again, behind our dripping captain the entire
ship’s company straggled across the ice-foot to solid
ground (the steep face of the cliff), where clinging to the
precipice with one hand, the captain for the third time on our
voyage displayed his silken banner, proudly rammed its staff
for a moment into the soil, and exclaimed,</p>

<p>“Men, this is newly discovered land. I therefore take possession
of it in the name of the President of the United States,
and name it,</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Bennett Island!</span>”</p>

<p>The men, most of them (except the five who had landed
with me on Henrietta Island) with their feet on solid ground
for the first time in two years, cheered lustily. Jack Cole then
sang out,</p>

<p>“All hands, now. Three cheers fer Cap’n De Long!” in
which all again joined except Collins and (for the first time
in his life managing to keep his mouth shut when anybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
gave him an order) Newcomb.</p>

<p>But our happy captain, not noticing that, turned to his
executive officer and jocularly remarked,</p>

<p>“We’ve been a long time afloat, Mr. Chipp. You may now
give the men all the shore leave they wish on American soil!”</p>

<p>It was July 28th when we landed; we stayed a week on
Bennett Island, resting mainly, while Nindemann and Sweetman
worked strenuously repairing our boats. All were badly
damaged and unseaworthy from the pounding they had received
in the pack. The whaleboat especially, our longest
boat, had suffered severely and every plank in its stern was
sprung wide open. Sweetman did the best he could in hurrying
repairs, pouring grease into the leaking seams and refastening
planks, but it was a slow job nevertheless.</p>

<p>While this was going on, the men explored Bennett Island,
which we found to be of considerable extent (we never got
to its northwest cape), probably thirty miles long and over
ten miles wide, very mountainous, with many glaciers, running
streams, no game we ever saw, and thousands of birds
nesting on the cliffs. This island, at least three times the size
of Henrietta Island, nicely finished off the honors due the
Bennett family, for we now had one each for Mr. Bennett, his
sister, and his mother.</p>

<p>Geologically, we found the island interesting. I discovered
a thick vein of bituminous coal, and Dr. Ambler found many
deposits of amethyst crystals, but what took our fancy most
were the birds. We knocked down innumerable murres with
stones, which, fried in bear’s grease, we ate with great relish.
But they proved too much for Dr. Ambler’s stomach, laying
him in his tent for over a day.</p>

<p>On August 4th, with the boats all repaired, we made ready
to leave. To the southward of Bennett Island, the pack looked
to us badly broken up with enough large water openings to
make it seem that thereafter we could proceed mostly in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
boats among drifting floes, keeping the sledges for use when
required. To this end, since the dogs would be less necessary
and feeding them on our pemmican an unwarranted further
drain on our stores, De Long ordered ten broken-down dogs
to be shot to avoid their suffering should we abandon them,
keeping only the twelve best for future sledging, including
husky Snoozer who was by now quite the captain’s pet.</p>

<p>By sledge over the pack we had travelled almost exactly a
hundred miles in a straight line from where the <em>Jeannette</em>
had sunk to Bennett Island, though over the winding track as
we actually crossed the drifting ice we had dragged our
sledges more than a hundred and eighty miles and in so doing
had ourselves tramped far beyond a thousand miles on foot.
We prepared hopefully to rely from then on mainly on our
boats, and for this purpose the captain rearranged the parties,
breaking up the sledge and tent groups in which we previously
had journeyed.</p>

<p>Into the first cutter with himself he took a total of thirteen—Dr.
Ambler, Mr. Collins, Nindemann, Erichsen, Kaack,
Boyd, Alexey, Lee, Noros, Dressler, Görtz and Iversen.</p>

<p>Into the second cutter (a smaller boat) under Lieutenant
Chipp’s command, he put ten—Mr. Dunbar, Sweetman, Sharvell,
Kuehne, Starr, Manson (later transferred to my boat),
Warren, Johnson, and Ah Sam (who later to lighten still
further the second cutter, was transferred to De Long’s
boat).</p>

<p>Into the whaleboat, of which he gave me the command,
also went ten—Lieutenant Danenhower, Mr. Newcomb, Cole,
Bartlett, Aneguin, Wilson, Lauterbach, Leach, and Tong
Sing.</p>

<p>Thus we made ready, with De Long commanding the
largest and roomiest boat, Chipp commanding the smallest
boat, and me in command of the whaleboat, considerably our
longest craft though not our greatest in carrying capacity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
And promptly there flared up in the Arctic an echo of that
Line and Staff officer controversy agitating our Navy at
home. (At home, it lasted until the Spanish War showed that
we engineers were as important in winning battles as deck
officers, and maybe more so.)</p>

<p>I, as an engineer officer, belonged to the Staff; Danenhower,
as a deck officer, belonged to the Line, which alone
maintained the claim to actual command of vessels afloat.
A whaleboat was not much of a vessel, but nevertheless
Danenhower, when he heard of the assignments, promptly informed
me he was going to protest to the captain.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Dan,” I said. “That’s perfectly all right with
me.” So the navigator went to the captain to object to a staff
officer being given command while he, a line officer, was put
under my orders. In that congested camp on Bennett Island,
he didn’t have far to go to find the skipper.</p>

<p>“Captain,” asked Dan, “what’s my status in the whaleboat?”</p>

<p>“You are on the sicklist, sir,” replied De Long.</p>

<p>“Who has command of the boat?” persisted Dan.</p>

<p>“Mr. Melville, under my general command.”</p>

<p>“And in case of a separation of the boats?” questioned the
navigator. “Suppose we lose you?”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said the captain, “Mr. Melville has my written
orders to command that boat and what to do with her.”</p>

<p>“Am I under his orders?”</p>

<p>“Yes, so far as it may be necessary for you to receive
orders from him.”</p>

<p>“But that puts me under the orders of a staff officer!” objected
Dan strenuously.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re unfit to take command of the boat yourself,”
pointed out the skipper. “You can’t see, Mr. Danenhower. I
can’t put you on duty now. So long as you remain on the
sicklist, you will be assigned to no military control whatever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<p>“Why can’t I be put in a boat with a line officer, then?”
asked Dan, the idea of having to report to a staff officer rankling
badly.</p>

<p>“Because I have no line officer left to put in that boat with
you, and because I have seen fit so to distribute our party. I
want one line officer in each boat. In an emergency, Mr. Melville
may wish to have your advice on matters of seamanship.”</p>

<p>“Well then,” replied Danenhower vehemently, “I remonstrate
against being kept on the sicklist.”</p>

<p>“But you’re sick and that’s nonsensical,” said De Long
curtly.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, haven’t I the right to remonstrate?”</p>

<p>“You have, and I’ve heard you, and your remonstrance has
no effect,” replied the captain bluntly. “I’ve had the anxiety
of your care and preservation for two years and your coming
to me on these points now is simply an annoyance. I will not
assign you to duty till you’re fit for it, and that will be when
the doctor discharges you from the sicklist. I will not put
other people’s lives in jeopardy by committing them to your
charge, and I consider your urging me to do so is very un-officer-like
conduct.”</p>

<p>Taken aback at this barbed comment on his complaint,
Danenhower asked hesitantly,</p>

<p>“Am I to take that as a private reprimand?”</p>

<p>“You can take it any way you please, Mr. Danenhower,”
concluded the irritated De Long, walking away to supervise
the loading of the first cutter, leaving the crestfallen navigator
no alternative but to come back to join me in the whaleboat.</p>

<p>“Don’t take it so hard, Dan,” I suggested. “Too bad about
your eyes, of course, but it can’t be helped now. We’ve always
been the best of friends and we’re not going to let this
change things. As long as you’re in the whaleboat, you can
count on me, old man, not to say or do anything that’ll hurt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
your feelings as an officer. Hop in, now; we’re shoving off!”</p>

<p>Already delayed two days by bad weather, on August
6th we got away from Bennett Island, with intense satisfaction,
though the wind had died away, being able to get
underway in our boats under oars, carrying the sledges and
our twelve remaining dogs. The boats, of course, packed with
men, food, records, sledges, and dogs, were heavily overloaded
and in no condition to stand rough weather, but we had
smooth water and we made two miles before bringing up
against a large ice island. Here we lost most of our dogs, who
not liking water anyway, and objecting still more to the unavoidable
mauling they were getting in the crowded boats
from the swinging oars, promptly deserted the moment they
saw ice again, by leaping out on the floe, and we were unable
to catch them. We worked around the ice pack in the boats,
by evening getting to its southern side, where we camped
on the ice, with five miles between us and Bennett Island, a
good day’s work and a heaven-sent relief from sledging.</p>

<p>The weather was startlingly clear. Looking back, we got a
marvelous view of the island. When we had first reached it in
late July, its appearance was quite summery with mossy
slopes and running streams, but now winter had hit it with a
vengeance. Everything on it was snow-covered and the
streams were freezing. We regarded it with foreboding. The
first week of August and the brief Arctic summer was fading
away, with four hundred miles before us still to go on our
journey to the Lena Delta. We must hurry, or the open leads
we now had for the boats would all soon freeze over.</p>

<p>For two weeks we stood on to the southwest, boating and
sledging. With luck in pushing away the ice with boathooks,
we might make five or six miles between broken floes before
we met a pack we could not get through afloat, when it was
a case of unload the boats, mount them on their sledges, and
drag across the ice. By the second day of this, we were down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
to two dogs, Snoozer and Kasmatka, all the rest having deserted,
but these two special favorites were kept tied and so
prevented from decamping. The boat work, whether under
sail or oars, was hard labor. There was no open sea, merely
leads in the open pack, and over most of these leads, the
weather was now cold enough to freeze ice a quarter of an
inch thick over night. We found we could not row through
this, so the leading boat, usually the first cutter, had to break
a way, and all day long men were poised in her bows with
boathooks and oars breaking up the ice ahead. And we had
before us several hundred miles of this!</p>

<p>The weather was bad, mostly fog, snow squalls, and some
gales, but because of the vast amount of floating ice, there
was no room for a heavy sea to kick up, and when a moderate
sea rose, we always hauled out on the nearest floe. And so
camping on the ice at night, hauling out for dinner, and
making what we could under sail or oars in between when we
were not sledging over the pack, we stood on to the southwest
for the New Siberian Islands. At the end of one week’s
journeying, the snowfalls became frequent and heavy, troubling
us greatly, though they did provide us with good drinking
water which was an improvement over the semi-salted
snow we got on the main pack. By now it was the middle of
August, sixty days since we had left the <em>Jeannette</em>, and the
expiration of the period for which originally we had provided
food. We were hundreds of miles from our destination,
and our food was getting low. Of course had it not been for
our going on short rations soon after our start, our position
would now be precarious, since the few seals, birds, and the
solitary bear we got, while luxurious breaks in our menu so
long as they lasted (which wasn’t long) meant little in the
way of quantity.</p>

<p>By August 16th, nine days underway from Bennett Island,
we had made only forty miles—not very encouraging. Next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
day we did better—ten miles under sail with only one break,
but the day after, it was once more all pulling with the oars
and smashing ice ahead and slow work again. But on August
19th we saw so much open water that we joyfully imagined
we were near the open sea at last. We loosed our sails and
until noon went swiftly onward with the intention of getting
dinner in our boats for the first time without hauling out on
the ice, and then continuing on all night also. Suddenly astern
of us we saw Chipp’s boat hastily douse sail, run in against a
floe, and promptly start to unload.</p>

<p>There was nothing for the rest of us (cursing fluently at
the delay) to do except to round to and secure to the ice till
Chipp came up, and long before he had managed that, the ice
came down on us from all sides before a northeast wind, so
that shortly it looked as if there was nothing but ice in the
world. Chipp finally sledged his boat over the pack to join
us and we learned the ice had closed on him suddenly, stove
a bad hole in his port bow, and he had to haul out hurriedly
to keep from sinking.</p>

<p>By three p.m., Chipp had his boat repaired, using a piece of
pemmican can for a patch, and we were again ready. Each
boat had its sledge, a heavy oaken affair, slung athwartships
across the gunwales just forward of the mast. Abaft that, the
boats were jammed with men and supplies, the result being
that they were both badly overloaded and topheavy.</p>

<p>With great difficulty we poled our way through ice drifts
packed about us to more open water and made sail again before
a freshening breeze, De Long in the first cutter leading,
my whaleboat in the middle, and Chipp with the second
cutter astern of all. We felt we must be nearing the northerly
coasts of the New Siberian Islands, which we hoped to
sight any moment and perhaps even reach by night.</p>

<p>The breeze grew stronger and the sea started to kick up.
My whaleboat began to roll badly, taking in water over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
gunwales, and at the tiller I found it difficult to hold her
steady on the course, though with some bailing we got along
fairly well, and so it seemed to me did the first cutter ahead.
But the second cutter astern, the shortest boat of the three,
was behaving very badly in that sea—rolling heavily, sticking
her nose into the waves instead of rising to them, and evidently
making considerable water. Hauling away a little on
my quarter and drawing up so he could hail the captain ahead,
Chipp bellowed down the wind,</p>

<p>“Captain! I’ve either got to haul out on the ice or heave
overboard this sledge! If I don’t, I’ll swamp!”</p>

<p>De Long decided to haul out. He waved to Chipp and me
(he being to leeward, we couldn’t hear him) indicating that
we were to haul out on a floe nearby on our lee side. The
near side of that floe, its windward side, had a bad surf breaking
over the ice, so we tried to weather a point on the floe
and get around to its lee where we could see a safe cove to
haul out in, but our unwieldy boats would not sail close
enough to the wind, and we failed to make it. Chipp’s case
by this time was desperate; his boat was badly flooded and in
spite of all the bailing his men could do, the waterlogged
cutter seemed ready to sink under him. There was nothing
for it but to land on the weather side of the ice, which
dangerous maneuver, with a rolling sea breaking badly on the
floe and shooting surf high into the air, was skilfully accomplished
without, to our intense relief, smashing all our boats
beyond repair.</p>

<p>The gale grew worse. It was now 7:30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and beginning
to get dark. (Between the later season of the year and our
being farther south, we no longer had the midnight sun with
us, but instead about eight hours of darkness.) There was
no hope of further progress that night, so we pitched camp
on the floe, while the gale started to push ice in about us from
all directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>

<p>That night before supper, the captain called Chipp and me
to his tent. The question for discussion was the boat sledges.
We had since leaving Bennett Island broken up all our other
provision sledges and burned them for fuel. Chipp strenuously
insisted that the boat sledges be treated likewise immediately.</p>

<p>“Captain,” he said, “I’m surprised I’m here to talk about it
even! My boat’s so topheavy with that sledge across her rails,
a dozen times I thought she’d either founder or capsize. And
a man can’t swim a minute in these clothes in that ice water.
If she’d sunk under me, long before you or the chief could’ve
beat back against that wind to pick us up, we’d all be gone!”</p>

<p>With Chipp’s facts, honestly enough stated, De Long was
inclined to agree and so was I, but the question was too serious
to be decided out of hand. On our first journey across the
pack, the sledges were our salvation, and it was the heavy
boats (holding us back like anchors) which we then gravely
considered abandoning lest our party perish before we ever
reached water. Now the situation was reversed; it was those
boats, dragged across the ice at the cost of indescribable
agony, which had become our main hope of escape, but still
could we afford to abandon the sledges which so obviously
now imperilled our safety in the boats? We were not yet out
of the pack; one had only to poke his head through the tent
flap to see as much ice as ever we had seen. And if we had
to sledge over much more of the pack to get south, without
those boat sledges we couldn’t do it. What then should be
done with the sledges?</p>

<p>With our lives very likely depending on that decision, we
considered it deeply. The conclusion, concurred in by all, was
that the certainty of disaster if we kept the sledges, outweighed
the possibility of being now caught permanently in
pack ice, unable to move except by sledging, and De Long
finally give the order to burn the sledges. In a few minutes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
knives and hatchets in the hands of sailors eager to make an
end of those incubi before the captain could change his mind,
had reduced them to kindling and they were burning merrily
beneath our pots. No man regretted seeing them go who had
toiled in the harnesses dragging them and their bulky burden
of boats across the ice pack, laboring as men have never done
before, and as I hope may never have to again.</p>

<p>Further to help Chipp, the captain in expectation next
morning of a long voyage among the New Siberian Islands,
decided to even matters somewhat more by removing from
Chipp’s stubby cutter, only sixteen feet long, part of its load.
Accordingly he decreased its crew by two men, taking Ah
Sam (our Chinese cook who had since the sinking of the
<em>Jeannette</em> with nothing but pemmican on the menu, not
cooked a meal, serving instead only as a beast of burden like
all others) into the first cutter with him, and sending Manson,
a husky Swedish seaman, to join my crew in the whaleboat.
In addition, De Long took into the first cutter part of Chipp’s
supply of pemmican, still more to lighten his boat which was
certainly a worse sea boat than either my twenty-five foot
long whaleboat or his own twenty foot long cutter.</p>

<p>With these rearrangements, we camped for the night in
the midst of a howling gale drifting snow about our tents,
the while we earnestly hoped that the wind would break up
the pack in the morning, and allow us to proceed.</p>

<p>But instead, for ten wearing days we lay in that camp, unable
to launch a boat and unable of course to sledge them
over the broken pack, while the weather varied between gales
with heavy snow and dismal fogs, and we ate our hearts out
in inaction, watching our scanty food supplies constantly
melting away with no progress to show for it. Our hard bread
gave out altogether, our coffee was all used up, and our menu
came down to two items only, pemmican and tea three times
a day, with an ounce of our fast-vanishing lime-juice for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
breakfast to ward off scurvy. To save what little alcohol we
had left (we had been using it for fuel for making tea and
coffee) we continued to burn up the kindling from our boat
sledges, but long before we broke camp, even that was all
gone, and we started again on our precious alcohol.</p>

<p>The tobacco gave out (each man had been permitted to
take one pound with him from the <em>Jeannette</em>). To the captain,
an inveterate pipe smoker, this was a severe trial and left
him perfectly wretched, till Erichsen, who still had a trifle
left, generously shared with him the contents of his pouch.
De Long declined to take more than a pipeful, but Erichsen
insisting on an even division of his trifling remnant, the skipper
found he had enough for three smokes. Immediately seeking
out the doctor and Nindemann, he divided with them and
together they puffed on their pipes, in a mixed state of happiness
and despair watching the last tobacco from the <em>Jeannette</em>
curling upward in smoke wreaths into the Arctic air.</p>

<p>Next day, like the others, they were smoking used tea leaves
and getting little solace from them.</p>

<p>Our second day in this camp, through a rift in the fog we
sighted land twenty miles to the southward, in the captain’s
opinion the island of New Siberia, one of the largest islands
of the New Siberian group and the one farthest eastward in
that archipelago.</p>

<p>As the days went by and in the fog and snow we drifted
westward with the pack before an easterly gale, the knowledge
of that unapproachable island added to our aggravations.
We could do little except repair our boats (which, using
pemmican tallow, rags, and lampwick for caulking materials,
Nindemann and Sweetman labored at) and wait for the
pack to open, a constant watch night and day being set with
orders that if a lead appeared, we should immediately launch
our boats into it. But none showed up. In desperation at the
delay, which was bringing us face to face with the prospect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
of starvation, De Long again sent for Chipp and me.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chipp,” he asked, “can you move your boat across
this ice to the land?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Chipp flatly. “It’ll stave in her bottom trying
to ride her on her keel.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Melville,” turning to me, “can you get the whaleboat
across? Is this any worse than when you landed with
the dinghy on Henrietta Island?”</p>

<p>“Captain,” I replied sadly, “no worse, but it’s as bad; the
ice is just as much alive. And I didn’t take the little dinghy
to Henrietta Island, even on her sledge; I left her at the edge
of the moving pack. I can get the whaleboat across this ice
to that island if you order me, sir, but when she gets there,
she’ll be worthless as a boat.”</p>

<p>“Well, in that case,” remarked De Long, bitterly disappointed
at our views, “it’s no use taking them there.” And
while he didn’t voice it, there was little question but that he
deeply regretted having ever cut up the boat sledges. In my
opinion, however, sledges or no sledges, we couldn’t safely
get those boats through to the land over that swirling ice between.
We started to leave.</p>

<p>“Hold on a moment,” ordered De Long, pulling a book
out from under his parka, “there’s something else.” He pushed
his head out the tent flap, called to the man on watch in the
snow. “Send Seaman Starr in here!”</p>

<p>In a moment or two, Starr, with his snow-flecked bulk
practically filling the tent, stood beside us. The captain
opened the book. It was in German, one of Petermann’s publications,
the best we had on New Siberia and the Lena
Delta. Starr, aside from his Russian, could also read German,
and as he translated, De Long, Chipp, and I followed on the
chart, putting down Petermann’s data on the islands, and
especially on the Lena Delta, where near Cape Barkin were
marked winter huts and settlements, a signal station similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
to a lighthouse, and the indication that there we could get
native pilots to take us up the Lena. At this time the captain
warned me that should we be separated, Cape Barkin was to
be our rendezvous. At that point the delta formed a right-angled
corner. To the westward from Cape Barkin, the coast
ran due west; but at the cape itself, the coast turned and ran
sharply south for over a hundred miles, while through both
the northern and the eastern faces of this corner-like delta,
the Lena discharged in many branches to the sea. But Cape
Barkin at this corner we must make—there between the pilots
and the settlements shown by Petermann, our voyage would
end and our troubles would be over. The remainder of our
journey home would merely be a tedious and probably a slow
trip on reindeer sledges southward from the Siberian coast
inland fifteen hundred miles to Irkutsk, then a long jaunt
westward by post coaches to Moscow, and so back to America.
The captain marked it all out, made two copies of his
chart, one for me and one for Chipp, and then dismissing
Starr, told us,</p>

<p>“There are your charts with the courses laid out to Cape
Barkin. As I informed you in my written order at Bennett
Island, Melville, if unfortunately we are separated, you will
continue on till you make the mouth of the Lena River, and
without delay ascend the Lena to a Russian settlement from
which you can be forwarded with your party to a place of
safety and easy access. Try to reach some settlement large
enough to feed and shelter your men before thinking about
waiting for me. And the same for you, Chipp. That’s all,
gentlemen. Be ready to start the instant the ice breaks.” He
drew out his pipe, ending the discussion. We took our charts
and departed, leaving the skipper trying to light off a pipeful
of damp tea leaves.</p>

<p>On August 29th, after ten days of fuming in idleness during
which time our pack drifted first westward and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
southward, the weather cleared a bit and we found ourselves
between Fadejovski and New Siberia Islands, and closer to
Fadejovski, the western one of the pair. At noon, Dunbar
scouting on the pack, reported a lead half a mile away. Immediately
we broke camp, and carrying our provisions on
our backs while we carefully skidded our boats along on their
keels, we dragged across that half mile of floe to the water
and launched our boats, thankful even for the chance the
remainder of the afternoon to fight our way through swirling
ice cakes to the southward. The drift in that lead was rapid,
the broken ice there was violently tumbling and eddying, and
as we swept down the bleak coast five miles off Fadejovski
Island unsheltered from the intense cold, with oars and boat
hooks savagely fending off those heaving floes on all sides of
us to keep our frail boats from being crushed, it was like
making passage through the very gates of hell! For two horrible
days we worked along the coast fighting off impending
death in that swirling maelstrom of ice, when with the pack
thinning somewhat, we managed at last to work our way to
land on the southerly end of Fadejovski, three weeks underway
since leaving Bennett Island, and humbly grateful to
find ourselves disembarking still alive.</p>

<p>We stayed one night on a mossy slope trying to thaw our
frozen feet by tramping on something other than ice, and as
Dunbar expressively put it, “Sanding our hoofs.” They
needed it. The most pleased member of our party was Snoozer,
now our sole remaining dog, who joyously tore round chasing
lemmings, while we sought for real game which we didn’t
find. And that night was served out our last ration of lime-juice
which so heroically salvaged by Starr from the sinking
<em>Jeannette</em>, had shielded us from scurvy for two and a half
months on our tramp over the ice. But we saw the last drops
of that unsavory medicine disappear without regret and
without foreboding for the future, for now we were nearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
the open sea and our voyage was nearing its end.</p>

<p>Next morning we shoved off from the south end of Fadejovski,
only to discover despondently that we had embarked
on a twelve days’ odyssey through the New Siberian Archipelago
before which our previous sufferings seemed nothing.
We had not wholly lost the ice; instead we had only added
to our previous perils some new ones—vast hidden shoals,
bitter freezing weather, long nights of sitting motionless and
cramped in our open boats, while the Arctic winds mercilessly
pierced our unshielded bodies, and the hourly dread of
drowning in a gale.</p>

<p>It was seventy miles over the sea to Kotelnoi, the next
island westward in the group. To get there, instead of being
able to sail directly west, we found we had to stand far to
the southward of Fadejovski to clear a shoal, getting out of
sight of land. When night caught us far out in the open sea,
we discovered even there shoals with less than two feet of
water, over which a heavy surf was breaking badly. Standing
off into deeper water, we beat all night into the wind to save
ourselves from destruction, for we had no anchors in our
boats. Wet, miserable, frozen by spray coming over, we stayed
in the boats, so crowded we could not move our freezing
legs. At dawn we stood on again westward, with streaming
ice bobbing all about us, traveling before a fresh breeze all
day. In the late afternoon, having lost sight of Chipp and the
second cutter, his boat being unable to keep up, we finally
spotted a floe sizeable enough to camp on. De Long signalled
me to stop; we promptly secured to it and waited for Chipp
to catch up, meanwhile for the first time in thirty-six hours
stretching our wet forms out in our sleeping bags on the ice,
while a gale blew up, snow fell, and the sea got very rough,
which gave us grave concern over our missing boat. By daylight
there was so much pack ice surrounding our two boats,
it seemed unbelievable we had arrived there by water, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
our anxiety for Chipp increased. We lay all day icebound,
all night, and all next day, occasionally sighting the mountains
on Kotelnoi Island, perhaps ten miles to the westward. And
then Chipp and the second cutter finally showed up, coasting
the north side of our floe, half a mile away across the
pack, and soon Chipp and Kuehne, walking across the ice,
were with us. They had had a terrible time the night we lost
them; long before they sighted any floes, the gale caught
them, and over the stern where Chipp and Dunbar sat steering,
icy seas tumbled so badly that all hands bailing hardly
kept the boat afloat till they finally found a drifting floe.
When at last he steered in under the lee of the ice, but one
man, Starr, was still able to jump from the boat and hold
her in with the painter while the others, badly frozen, could
barely crawl out over the gunwale. He himself and Dunbar
in the sternsheets found themselves so cramped from sitting
at the tiller that they could not even crawl and had to be
lifted by Starr from the boat. To warm up his men, Chipp
had served out immediately two ounces of brandy each, but
Dunbar was so far gone that he promptly threw his up and
fainted. The second day, underway again, he had kept westward
for thirty miles before sighting us in the late afternoon,
and there he was, with his crew badly knocked out, in the
open water on the edge of the pack surrounding us completely.</p>

<p>To get underway next morning, there was nothing for
it but to move our two boats over the ice to where Chipp’s
was, and with no sledges, we faced that portage over bad
ice with deep trepidation. Five men, headed by Nindemann,
went ahead with our solitary pick-ax and some carpenter’s
chisels to level a road. We carried all our clothes and knapsacks
on our backs, but De Long dared not take the pemmican
cans from the boats, for so scanty was our food supply
getting that the chance of any man’s stumbling and losing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
can of pemmican down a crack in the ice was a major tragedy
not to be risked. So food and all, the boats had to be
skidded on their keels over the ice, leaving long strips of oak
peeled off the keels by the sharp floe edges as we dragged
along. As carefully as we could, all hands at a time on one
boat, we lightered them along that half mile, and when after
seven fearful hours of labor we got them into the water,
it was with unmitigated joy we saw they still floated.</p>

<p>We made a hasty meal of cold pemmican, and all hands
embarked. De Long, last off to board his cutter, was bracing
himself on the floe edge to climb aboard, when the ice
gave way beneath him, and he went overboard, disappearing
completely beneath the surface. Fortunately, Erichsen
in the cockpit got a grip on him while he was still totally
submerged (for he might not ever have risen except under
the widespread pack) and hauled him, completely soaked to
the skin, in over the stern. Without delay, except to wipe the
water from his eyes, the captain signalled us to make sail.</p>

<p>We fought again fog, ice, and shoals for six hours more
to cover the last ten miles to Kotelnoi, and when night finally
caught us, all we knew was that we were on a sandbank
where we gladly pitched camp, in total ignorance of whether
we had made the island itself or an offshore bank and caring
less so long as we could stop. We found some driftwood on
the bank, made a fire, and soon, most of all the captain still
in his soaked clothes, we were trying to warm ourselves
around it. So ended September 4th.</p>

<p>The next two days we tried to struggle west along the
south coast of Kotelnoi, largest island of the archipelago,
but a blinding snow-storm and ice closing in held us to our
sand spit. Going inshore, some of the men found the
long-deserted huts of the fossil ivory hunters, and even a few
elephant tusks, but not a trace of game, and our supply of
pemmican kept on shrinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>Signs of physical breakdown were becoming plain enough
in our company. Our rations were slender and unsatisfying.
Long hours on end of sitting cramped and soaked in wet
clothes and icy water, often unable in the overcrowded
boats even to stretch a leg to relieve it, no chance in the boats
to stretch out and sleep at all, and the mental strain of working
those small boats in tumbling seas and through tossing
ice, were beginning to tell. On the pack at least, each night
we could camp and stretch ourselves in our bags to rest
after each day of toil; now except when bailing, we were
compelled to endure the cold motionless.</p>

<p>Captain De Long’s feet were giving way. Swollen with
cold and with toes broken out with chilblains, he could barely
move about, and then only in great pain. Dunbar looked
older than ever, fainted frequently, and the doctor said his
heart showed a weakness that might carry him off under any
strain. De Long admonished the ice-pilot to give up all work
and take things easy, but even merely sitting up in the boat
was a strain which could not be avoided. To keep him braced
up, the doctor gave him a flask of brandy with orders to
use it regularly. Danenhower’s eyes continued the same—poor,
but with one eye at least partly usable when the sun
did not shine, which fortunately for Dan in all that fog and
snow was most of the time. But Dan continued to pester the
doctor to put him off the sicklist, driving Ambler nearly wild
that he should be nagged to consider such an unethical request.
Others too began to complain—Erichsen of his feet,
Cole of a general dullness in his head. As for all the rest of
us, gaunt and underfed, with seamed and cracked faces, untrimmed
whiskers, haggard eyes, shivering bodies, and raw
and bleeding hands and feet, against a really well man we
would have stood out as objects of horror, but there being
none such amongst us, our appearance excited no special
comment among ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span></p>

<p>Our third day on Kotelnoi, we managed to work a few
miles to the westward along the coast, rowing and dragging
our boats along the sand, making perhaps thirteen miles inshore
of the ice pack which we could not penetrate to the sea
beyond. But on September 7th, before an early morning
northeast breeze with the temperature well below freezing,
the pack opened up and we sailed away through drifting ice
streaming before the wind, for Stolbovoi Island, sixty-five
miles southwest. By noon, I concluded that somehow I must
have stove in the bottom of my boat, for we were making
water faster than it could be bailed and the boat started to
sink. Signalling the others, I hastily ran alongside a nearby
floe, where my crew had a lively time getting the whaleboat
up on the ice before she went from under us. Capsizing her
to learn the damage, I was much relieved to find we had
only knocked the plug up out of the drain hole. We found
the plug beneath the overturned boat, tried it again in the
hole, and found it projected through an inch. Evidently
bumping on some ice beneath the bilge had knocked it out,
so I sawed off the projection to prevent a recurrence, righted
and floated my boat again. Meanwhile being on the ice, we
all had dinner and shoved off again.</p>

<p>With a fair breeze, we stood southwest for Stolbovoi
Island, fifty miles off now. The breeze freshened and we
made good progress, too good indeed for Chipp and the
second cutter, as both De Long and I had to double reef our
sails to avoid completely losing Chipp astern again. The sea
increased somewhat, the boats rolled badly, and we had to
bail continuously, but as we were getting along toward the
Lena, that didn’t worry us, nor did the fact that being poor
sailors, Collins, Newcomb, and Ah Sam became deathly seasick
again.</p>

<p>We kept on through the night, delayed a bit from midnight
until dawn by streaming ice we couldn’t see and cold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
wet, and wretched as usual. Several times during the night
we were nearly smashed by being hurled by surf against unseen
floes. Once, under oars, I had to tow the captain’s boat
clear of a lee shore of ice from which he couldn’t claw off,
to save him from destruction. But after daybreak, we could
see better our dangers and avoid them in time, so that we
stood on all day till four in the afternoon, when having been
underway thirty-three hours in extreme danger and discomfort,
the captain signalled to haul out and camp on a solitary
floe nearby. Long before this, we should have hit Stolbovoi,
but a shift in the wind had apparently carried us by it to the
north.</p>

<p>After a cold night on this floe, at four in the morning on
September 9th we were again underway through rain and
snow. By afternoon we were picking a path through an
immense field of drifting floes which luckily we penetrated
and got through to the southwest, when sighting a low island
to the westward, evidently Semenovski, the last island of the
New Siberian Archipelago between us and the Lena, we
abandoned all idea of searching to the southward for Stolbovoi
which we had never sighted, and headed west instead
for Semenovski. As luck would have it, the wind of which
we had too much the day before to suit some members of
our party, now died away completely and out went our
oars. Through a calm sea we rowed the lumbering boats for
six hours, warming up the oarsmen at any rate, though horribly
chafing their frozen hands. Then, a fog setting in at
10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and it being impossible to see the other boats, the
captain sang out through the night to haul out on the ice,
where by candlelight we ate our pemmican.</p>

<p>Next day, September 10th, still rowing through the fog,
we made Semenovski by noon, and after a passage of one
hundred and ten miles from Kotelnoi, we beached our boats
and camped for a much needed rest. We were all of us stiff,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
frozen, and sore, but Dunbar especially was quite feeble and
looked indeed to be on his last legs.</p>

<p>Semenovski, a tiny island, was to be our last stop before
crossing ninety miles of open ocean to Cape Barkin on the
Lena Delta, with little chance on that leg of meeting any floes
large enough to haul out on for shelter in case the sea kicked
up. So while a few men went out with rifles to look for game,
we turned to in a final effort to make our boats more seaworthy
for this last ocean leg, our experiences so far in
rough water strongly indicating the need for improvement.
On my whaleboat, I took the canvas boat cover, and by nailing
it firmly to both bows and securing it tightly around
the mast, I decked over my bow, forming a sort of canvas
forecastle. The rest of the boat cover, from the mast aft to
the stern, I split in half lengthwise, giving me two long strips
of canvas which I nailed fore and aft to the sides. Then making
a set of small stanchions which were lashed to the gunwale
on each side as supports, I had both starboard and port
a flexible canvas weathercloth eighteen inches high which
the men on the windward side could hold up with their
backs against the fixed stanchions, in effect raising our rail
eighteen inches above the gunwale on either or both sides,
but allowing us to drop the weatherscreens instantly should
it become necessary to get out the oars. Cole and Bartlett did
this work on my whaleboat. Nindemann on the first cutter,
and Sweetman on the second cutter, fitted them out in a generally
similar manner.</p>

<p>While this was going on, our hunters, accompanied by a
dozen others as beaters, spread across the narrow island and
started to sweep it from north to south. They soon started up
a doe and its fawn, which fled in fright, but before long a rifle
shot knocked down the doe which, quickly tossed over a
small cliff onto the beach, was brought in a boat to our camp.
Needless to say, all else was suspended, driftwood gathered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
and at four o’clock, though it was long before our supper
hour, we turned to on a pound of venison steak apiece, which
I have little doubt surprised our astonished stomachs, as, accompanied
by hot tea, it went down our throats instead of
the usual pemmican. That held us until 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, when we had
our regular supper (slightly delayed), consisting of somewhat
more than a pound each this time of roast deer, which cleaned
up the deer completely except for her bones. Out of these
we intended to make soup next day, all except one meaty
bone which went to the overjoyed Snoozer. And with that,
we felt well fed for the first time since Görtz provided us
with bear steaks a month and a half before off Bennett Island,
bear steaks so far removed from us now in point of time and
suffering between, that it seemed almost in a previous incarnation
we must have enjoyed that bear!</p>

<p>During our second supper, it blew up half a gale and
started to snow, so the captain announced that since the next
day was Sunday, instead of getting underway, we would rest
on Semenovski, finish our boat work, and if we could, get
that fawn, shoving off Monday for the Lena. I thought this
suited all hands, but apparently it didn’t for I heard Collins
grumbling to Bartlett,</p>

<p>“Losing over a day for the sake of a feed of meat!”</p>

<p>I looked at the sullen Collins curiously. Whatever the
captain did or didn’t do was wrong with him. Yet he had
downed his “feed of meat” as voraciously as anybody, but
perhaps since he expected to taste it again when he heaved
it up after we got into the tossing boats, another feed didn’t
mean as much to him as to a sailor.</p>

<p>Sunday, as on every Sunday without exception which we
had passed whether on the pack or in the boats since the
<em>Jeannette</em> went down, after mustering the crew and reading
them the Articles of War, De Long held Divine Service in
his tent, attended as usual only by Chipp, Ambler, Dunbar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
Danenhower, and myself. Solemnly we listened, seamen about
to embark in frail shells for a long and dangerous voyage
across the open Arctic Sea, as De Long reverently read the
service, and never were we more sincere in our lives than
when at the end our rough voices, mingling with the freezing
gale howling outside, rose in the final fervent plea,</p>

<p>There was a fresh east wind blowing, the temperature was
just below freezing, and it appeared that we were in for a
wintry passage. The island behind us as we drew off was a
mass of white snow standing out from the dull gray sea.
Whitecaps were running everywhere. As we had anticipated,
there was little floating ice in sight.</p>

<p>For the first hour, we made good progress, shielded somewhat
by Vasselevski Island to windward, this latter being a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
small island a little to the southeast of Semenovski. By 9:30
<span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, however, we had cleared Vasselevski and received the
full force of the sea, careening to it as the boats sped along
with the taut sheets singing and our dipping lug sails drawing
full. For two hours we sailed on thus, the first cutter
leading, my whaleboat next, and Chipp in the second cutter
following me, all the boats tossing considerably. At noon, we
found ourselves running again through a moderately open
drifting pack, which since we had expected to encounter
no ice south of Semenovski, disturbed us exceedingly. But
accepting what fate sent us, we seized the opportunity,
hauled in alongside a floe, and disembarked for dinner—cold
pemmican and hot tea boiled over alcohol stoves. I now had
five days’ short rations left in my boat, but this worried me
little as Chipp and I, stretching our legs on the ice for a few
minutes before reembarking, discussed our prospects. We
were both very hopeful; with the wind holding as it was
from the east, we should make the last eighty miles to Cape
Barkin and the Lena Delta with only one night at sea spent
in our boats, and then good-by forever to hardship and
to pemmican!</p>

<p>“By the way, brother,” I asked, looking into Chipp’s wan
face, so thin now that the resemblance which he once bore
to General Grant had completely vanished (unless perhaps
Grant also looked like that during his Richmond campaign
after the Wilderness), “have you taken aboard yet that can
of pemmican De Long is carrying for you? That’s your total
food supply from now on, you know.”</p>

<p>“No, the skipper’s still got it,” answered Chipp. “But I’m
not bothering; I’ll get it from him in the morning if we still
need it, which I doubt. Don’t worry, old fellow,” and jokingly
he slapped me on the back. “I never expect to have to
eat that damned pemmican again!”</p>

<p>“Well, good luck and mind your sailing then, mate.” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
shook Chipp’s hand warmly. “We’ll stay reefed down so you
can keep up with us.”</p>

<p>With a wave, I left him. Chipp was far and away the best
seaman of us all—no need to worry over him. I hastened
back to my own boat, filled up all our pots with freshly-fallen
snow to be used for drinking water on our voyage,
and in a few minutes, we all shoved off and were underway
again, De Long’s last admonition to both of us being to keep
formation astern of him and hold our little squadron together.</p>

<p>The wind continually freshened and soon hauled to the
northeast, dead astern of us. This made the sailing more hazardous,
for we now were constantly exposed to the danger
of jibing our sails, but for some hours more, we bounced
along over rough seas, on the whole grateful for the occasional
drifting floes we encountered because they tended to
break the waves. I managed to maneuver safely amongst
these floating menaces until four o’clock, when following the
first cutter through a narrow passage between two floes, a
wave hurled my whaleboat to leeward, staving in our starboard
side against sharp ice and I hurriedly had to haul the
boat out on the floe to keep from losing her. In fifteen minutes,
while the other boats lay to in the lee of that ice, I
had her repaired by tacking a box cover over the hole, and
overboard again, we filled away to the southwest in regular
formation. That (though I soon had cause to regret it) was
the last of the ice pack we ever saw.</p>

<p>In the open Arctic finally, we ran on, the breeze freshening
all the time from the northeast and the sea picking up.
Before long, Chipp began to drop steadily astern, since both
De Long’s cutter and my whaleboat were far better sailors
than his short cutter. To avoid losing him, we had to reef
sail, first taking one reef, and soon a second, after which
both the leading boats ran close-reefed while Chipp, with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
sail full out, barely managed to hold position in column
in my wake.</p>

<p>Jack Cole, who was my coxswain, had been steering since
morning. Jack, put in my boat by De Long because he had
been such an excellent small boat sailor, was, however, now
a severe disappointment to me. For some days he had been
dull and apathetic, seeming hardly to know what was going
on in the boat. The weather we were facing required prompt
and vigorous action at the helm, so with some reluctance I
relieved Cole of the tiller, replacing him with Seaman Leach,
and detailing Manson and Wilson, good sailors both, to take
the tricks following, intending to relieve Leach in four hours.</p>

<p>As the late afternoon faded, the wind whipped up to gale
force. Spray came in over our stern, soaking all of us through
and through, while the freezing wind chilled us to the bone.
Wet and miserable, buoyed only by the thought that before
that gale we should certainly make the Lena and safety by
morning, we struggled to hold position, my whaleboat pitching
and rolling badly, while ahead and astern of us, we could
see the other boats heaving even more crazily in the seas,
a sight which did little to encourage us. To keep from jibing,
running free as we were, I was forced to station a man with
a boathook to hold out the sail; and not daring to trust anyone
else with the job, I manned the sheet myself, hour after
hour clinging to that freezing manila line. Heavy spray began
to break over our stern, and we started bailing.</p>

<p>But despite close reefs and frequently dousing sail to
deaden headway, we began to run ahead of the first cutter,
which heavily laden as that square-sterned boat was with
the records of the expedition, its stores, and more men than
any other, proved a slower sailer than my double-ended
whaleboat. Vainly I tried to hold astern of the first cutter,
but each time I doused sail, the racing seas combing over our
stern came heavily aboard, forcing us to bail vigorously to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
avoid waterlogging. By seven o’clock in the fading twilight
with the wind blowing a lively gale and the sea, already
bad, rapidly getting worse, I found my little boat in spite
of all my efforts a thousand yards out on the weather bow
of the first cutter and steadily gaining on her.</p>

<p>At this moment, Manson sang out,</p>

<p>“Chief, Ay tank dat cutter ban making signals to us!”</p>

<p>Looking astern across the waves, I saw De Long waving
to me, apparently to come within hail. We were already
close-reefed and there was no way to achieve this except
by dousing sail again and drifting while he caught up, so I
stationed several men to gather in the foot of the sail (she
was rigged with a single mast and a dipping lug sail) while
the yard came down. We partly doused sail and slackened
speed, but as we did so, a sea caught us and boarded our
stern, flooding us all to our hips in icy water. The men holding
the foot of the sail, startled at the fear of swamping,
promptly let go and we had for a moment the chaos of a
flooded boat erratically heaving in the seas, a flapping sail
threatening to take the stick out of her, and every man bailing
wildly with any utensil at hand that would hold water.</p>

<p>We finally got her cleared and the sail hoisted to get some
headway and hold us before the seas, when we tried again.
Once more we were flooded, but while some bailed, the men
at the sail, strongly admonished to hang on no matter what
happened, clung to it this time, and we managed to drift
almost within hail of De Long. I could see him shouting to
me from his cockpit, but whatever he said (I being to windward
of him) was lost in the roar of the gale. Just then
another sea rolled up and combed over both boats, nearly
filling mine. Instantly I jumped to my feet and bellowed
down the wind to him,</p>

<p>“I can’t hold back, captain! It’s either run or swamp!”</p>

<p>Perhaps he heard me. I have a strong voice and I had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
wind behind me to carry my words along. At any rate, he
could see the situation and with another shout, also smothered
in the wind, he waved energetically, motioning me on.</p>

<p>I needed no more. Promptly loosing sail, we filled away,
still bailing our waterlogged craft, while I waved to him
in acknowledgment. De Long turned in his tossing cockpit,
and I then saw him motioning violently to Chipp, half a
mile astern, possibly wanting him to come close enough
aboard to toss over that forty-five-pound can of pemmican,
the only food Chipp’s men would have, before the gale and
the darkness separated them.</p>

<p>But I had my hands full in my own boat and paid little
attention. We hoisted sail, shook out one reef, and shot ahead
down the wind before another sea could catch us and finish
the job of swamping us completely. Having gathered sufficient
headway to maneuver a bit, I hauled the boat a few
points closer to the wind, so that instead of heading southwest
dead before it with the consequent grave danger of
jibing the sail and broaching to before the oncoming seas,
we now ran with the wind on our port quarter, heading
roughly south and driving hard amidst heavy seas. We had
our canvas weathercloths up on both sides, with the freezing
men in the boat, their backs against the cloths to hold
them in position, themselves all standing poised with pans
ready to bail in the brief intervals when not actually bailing.
And indeed, had it not been for those canvas weathercloths,
so carefully fitted the day before at Semenovski, we
should long since have foundered. As it was, we huddled
behind them, all save Leach at the tiller, with huge seas
rolling past our raised sides and sweeping heavily along the
billowing canvas screens, over which even so, spray and some
solid water from every crest dashed into the boat.</p>

<p>The sea was now running mountains. Our little boat was
tossing wildly, rising dizzily to every crest as it swept up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
then plunging madly down into the trough as the wave rolled
by. The wind roared on, icy spray cutting like a knife drove
into the boat, our sheets and halliards sang in the gale, while
the mast in its step creaked dismally and our yard whipped
so violently in spite of a double-reefed sail, that with each
gust as we rose on a crest and the wind caught us squarely,
I began to fear that both mast and sail would go flying from
us down the wind like a suddenly released gull.</p>

<p>“Look!” shouted Leach at the tiller. “The skipper’s signalling
us again, chief!”</p>

<p>“Never mind him!” I growled. “Watch your steering,
Leach. We’re on our own now. Nobody sees any more
signals for us!”</p>

<p>But nevertheless I looked aft myself through the twilight.
We were fast outdistancing the first cutter where half
a mile to windward already, I could see De Long gesticulating
in the stern. But Leach was mistaken; De Long seemed to be
waving to Chipp a thousand yards to windward of himself,
and now a mile astern of us. As I stared, shielding my eyes as
best I could from the sharp spray, I saw the second cutter
rise against the sky on the crest of a breaking wave, then sink
into the trough. Again she rose, when an immense sea swept
over her and she broached, lying helplessly broadside to
the gale! Instantly her sail jibed and the yard swung over,
binding yard and sail against the mast. A man sprang up,
sharply outlined against the horizon, struggling frenziedly
to clear the jammed sail from the mast, then the heeling boat
plunged broadside from my sight into the trough. The second
cutter had evidently swamped!</p>

<p>Suddenly sick, I watched that spot as wave after wave
rolled by, but nothing rose again, and only flying foam and
breaking seas met my gaze. Broken-hearted, I stared across
that mile of raging sea at the scene of that swift tragedy.
There was nothing we could do. No boat could ever beat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
a mile dead to windward against such waves; long before
we could even get our boat into the wind on the first tack,
the icy waters and the tumbling seas had ended the agony
of the men in the second cutter.</p>

<p>I sank back in the sternsheets, sobbing for the shipmates
I had lost. Quiet, taciturn Chipp, who by sheer will power
had conquered sickness to lead his men across the pack;
grizzled old Dunbar, who had broken his health scouting
paths for us over the ice; huge Starr, whose herculean back
had many a time lifted my jammed boat over the hummocks
in the pack; little Sharvell, whose comical seriousness had
often lightened our months of tedious drifting; Sweetman,
Warren, Johnson, Kuehne, good seamen every one—their
struggles were forever ended. All their agonizing labors to
escape from death in the pack had brought them only death
in the foaming waves. Now their voyage over, they were
slowly sinking through the cold depths to unmarked graves
in the desolate Arctic Sea!</p>

<p>Chipp, the best seaman of us all, had swamped in the gale,
and we were soon like to follow, for what chance was there
for us where his skill was insufficient? But at least we in the
whaleboat were still afloat. What of the first cutter? Fearfully,
I looked aft again for her.</p>

<p>Still half a mile off our starboard quarter, there she was,
plunging furiously along before the tumultuous waves, holding
grimly to her original course, southwest, dead before
the gale for Cape Barkin. I shook my head sadly. De Long
should haul closer to the wind. As he was heading, it would
be a miracle if the square-sterned first cutter lasted ten minutes,
for one bad jibe would dismast his boat and broach
her also, needing only another wave to send her tumbling
on her side to follow in Chipp’s wake. But it made little
difference. Regardless of course now, every sea combing
past seemed ready to swamp our two insignificant cockle-shells.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
Chipp was already gone. Any minute now, I confidently
expected to feel that strangling water in my throat,
after a few feeble struggles to be overwhelmed by the breaking
seas and, still gasping for air, to sink numbly through
the frigid water to join Chipp on the bottom.</p>

<p>I saw no more of the first cutter. On different courses,
she soon faded from our view into the night, and we were
left alone, eleven freezing men huddling in a tiny whaleboat
in a world of roaring winds, of mountainous seas, and of
utter blackness.</p>

<p>We drove along before the storm, the wind on our port
quarter, the rushing seas pressing madly against our port
side, with the canvas weathercloth there billowing and sagging
inboard as the crests swept along the canvas and poured
in over the top. Each time we slid sickeningly down into
a trough, all hands bailed for dear life, fighting to get the
flood sloshing round beneath the thwarts overboard before
we rose to the next crest and more water pouring aboard
from the succeeding wave swamped us completely. Every
pot and pan we had in the boat was pressed into service,
and except for Leach, who braced in the sternsheets, clung
to the tiller and steered, and except for me manning sheet
and sail myself to keep us from capsizing, the others in the
boat alternately pressed their shoulders back against the
weatherscreen to hold it up while rising to the crests, and
leaned forward, bailing furiously while sinking into the
troughs.</p>

<p>Numbed fingers clung to ice-coated pans, icy water
sloshed over our heads and down our necks, our frozen feet
had long since lost all sensation, and the careening boat beneath
us pitched, rolled, and heaved so dizzily that only
by clinging continuously to the thwarts did we manage to
escape being tossed bodily overboard.</p>

<p>Leach in the stern, the one man besides myself whose task<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
required him to stand motionless in one spot, did a miraculous
job of steering. Had he but once allowed her to swing
off the course we should have broached immediately and capsized.
But clinging to the tiller in the darkness, more by
feel than by such vague sight as the foaming crests sweeping
by gave him of the direction of the sea, he kept the wind
on the port quarter, standing himself wholly unprotected,
a fair target for each smashing wave breaking over the stern
to drench him completely.</p>

<p>Straining my eyes through the blackness as I clung to the
sheet, I watched the seas coming over and the men bailing.
It was obvious that we were fighting a losing battle. Even
though Leach at the helm and I at the sheet managed to
keep her from broaching or jibing or both at once, and thus
instantly ending the struggle, it was evident that those bailing
could not indefinitely keep ahead of the water coming
in over our stern, and sooner or later we should fill and
founder. Oh, for some drifting floes! If only we might run
into another field of ice which would at least deaden the
seas if not allow us to haul out on a floe! The ice pack,
which many times in the long months past I had cursed
vehemently, I now earnestly prayed for as our only sure
salvation. But we had long since dropped astern the last
floe, and now we must battle it out with the turbulent sea.
There was only one thing more I could do before my men,
barely able now to keep us afloat by bailing, between numbness
and exhaustion found themselves unable to keep the water
going overboard as fast as the tempestuous seas poured
it in. Regardless of the hazard involved, I must come about,
head into the crests, heave to, and ride out the gale bows
on, held that way by a sea anchor, while our canvas-decked
forecastle, instead of our open stern, took the brunt of the
oncoming waves.</p>

<p>But to heave to meant inviting quick destruction, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
maneuver involved turning broadside to the waves for an
instant as we swung our bow about to head into the wind.
To make matters worse, while in that critical position we
must use our oars to swing the boat and that meant dropping
our weathercloths down to the gunwales at the very
instant when most of all we needed every inch of freeboard
possible to avoid taking over a solid beam sea and foundering
out of hand.</p>

<p>Just abaft me, huddled against the weathercloth was
Danenhower. I leaned over in the darkness and shouted into
his ear,</p>

<p>“Dan, it’s blowing like blazes! We’d better heave to!”</p>

<p>Dan turned his face, with his bandage dripping water,
toward me and nodded,</p>

<p>“Yes, Melville. You should have done it long ago!” he
yelled back.</p>

<p>That startled me, for if he thought so, Dan should certainly
have made the suggestion himself. Why had he chosen
instead to keep his mouth shut? But it was no time to argue
why or wherefor. We must heave to.</p>

<p>“Get hold of Jack Cole!” I roared. “We’ll try it now!”</p>

<p>Soon in the sternsheets, Cole, Danenhower, and I were
debating what we should use for the sea anchor, or drag,
to which the boat must ride. Dan advised making the drag
of three of our oars with our sail lashed between them, but
this I refused to do, for if we lost the sea anchor, our oars
and sails would both be gone and then we would be helpless
indeed. Canvassing what little else we had in the boat to
stretch out the sides of a drag, I hit on three brass-tipped
tent poles, and these I ordered used, with a section of tent
cloth as the drag itself.</p>

<p>Working in the half-swamped boat, Cole and Manson
together made the drag, lashing the ends of the three tent
poles into a six-foot triangle, and then lacing inside it the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
piece of tent. Meantime Danenhower unrove a small block
and fall to get a line and from that manila line made up a
short three-legged bridle, one leg of which went to each
corner of the triangular drag, while all the rest of the line
was to serve as our anchor cable. The result of all this, when
we were through (which working under bad conditions in
the darkness took two hours) was that we had what looked
like a large triangular kite at the end of a long manila line,
the main difference being that our kite or sea anchor we
were going to fly in water instead of in air, and as it dragged
vertically through the water, it was to hold us head to the
oncoming seas that we might ride them bows-on.</p>

<p>On one matter at the end of all this, Cole and I differed.
The drag had to be heavy enough to sink beneath the surface,
for if it floated, it would be ineffective. But if it were
too heavy, it would sink too far and instead of streaming
out ahead of us, would hang vertically beneath our bows,
keeping them from rising to the seas, and helping to swamp
us. Cole stoutly maintained that the completed drag was
not heavy enough to sink. While somewhat inclined to
agree, I refused to add more weight, for to a buoyant drag
I could always add more ballast, but it was doubtful in that
storm that I could ever get my hands again on a sunken
drag to remove excess weight, until the boat having swamped,
I caught up with the submerged drag on my own way to
the bottom. However, to appease Jack, I got a copper fire-pot
ready to slide out on the line if it should be necessary
to add more weight, and we were ready to proceed.</p>

<p>At this point, Lieutenant Danenhower, who had been busy
making the bridle, spoke up again.</p>

<p>“Melville!” he sang out in my ear above the howling wind.
“Will you let me heave her to?”</p>

<p>I hesitated. Dan was over half blinded. But, I thought to
myself, in this darkness that was no great handicap; he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
probably see as much as anyone. And certainly as a deck
officer, he should know more about handling a boat in a
seaway than anyone else in her, including me, an engineer.
Our lives depended on that maneuver; I should be derelict
in my duty not to use the best talent available.</p>

<p>“Sure, Dan,” I replied, “go ahead and give the orders.
We’ll all do what you say.”</p>

<p>So to poor Danenhower, for nearly two years now nothing
but a helpless burden on the rest of us, had at last come
opportunity to serve. The crisp way in which he rattled out
the orders, stationing the men, infused new strength into the
exhausted crew. To stocky Bartlett went the most important
task; he was posted in the bow with the drag, and the
anchor line was carefully coiled down at his feet, ready for
running freely out when he heaved the drag over at the
word. Bosun Cole stood by the halliards to douse sail, with
Aneguin and Tong Sing to gather in the canvas as it came
down. I tended the sheet, Leach steered, Manson stood by
an oar poised high on the port side, and Wilson an oar similarly
ready to starboard. This left only Lauterbach to tend
to the bailing, for Newcomb, as always, was next to worthless
even though he now had the excuse of extreme seasickness
to mask his piddling efforts at real labor.</p>

<p>With a last all-hands dash to bail down as dry as possible,
the men took their stations. In silence and in darkness we
waited, holding up the weathercloths while several tremendous
waves rolled by and we rocked wildly to them. Judging
then that we should have a momentarily quieter sea,
Danenhower bellowed,</p>

<p>“Out oars! Starboard the helm! Down sail!”</p>

<p>Down dropped the weathercloths, out shot the two oars,
hard astarboard went the tiller, and down came the flapping
sail and yard as we swung off to port, trying quickly
to come about and head up into the sea. Wilson to starboard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
gave way valiantly on his oar while Manson to port backed
heavily on his, endeavoring to get her spun about before
the next wave caught us broadside, when with the boat
hardly more than a quarter way round—Crash! came a wave
tumbling in over our low gunwale and flooding us to the
thwarts!</p>

<p>Heaving to was forgotten. With might and main all hands
dropped their tasks to start bailing again except Leach and
the oarsmen who struggled desperately to straighten her out
again on her old course before the waterlogged whaleboat
broached to the next wave and capsized. By the grace of God
we succeeded in that, and hearts in our mouths, bailed madly
while with the oars alone we kept away before the sea
till the boat was sufficiently dry to risk coming about once
more.</p>

<p>After a hurried consultation with Dan, I stationed the men
as before, and we stood tensely by. Again we pitched crazily
to a succession of roaring crests and as we slid dizzily down
the trough of the third one, Dan once more sang out the
orders.</p>

<p>This time, with oars thrashing the sea in desperation, we
swung more quickly, and before the next wave struck, we
had the boat spun about, head on to its breaking crest as
our bow suddenly lifted to a tremendous wave.</p>

<p>“Let go the drag!” bawled Dan, and Bartlett in the bow
tossed over the canvas triangle. At that instant, the bow dived
sickeningly into the next trough, and Bartlett, off balance,
pitched headlong forward toward the sea!</p>

<p>For an instant I thought he was gone completely with
little chance of our getting to him before the sea swept him
away, but fortunately our slacked halliards were streaming
out over the bow and as Bartlett shot overboard he got his
right hand on the halliards, stopping his plunge. The next
second, as he hung there in air, the boat rose again to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
crest of a huge wave, the mast whipped back, and Bartlett
came flying inboard on the halliards against the mast to
which he clung for dear life as he slowly slid down to the
thwarts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile other things were rapidly happening. Still
manning the oars, Manson and Wilson were holding us head
to the seas while the drag line ran out and I watched it
anxiously till it brought up at the bitter end. In disappointment,
I saw that the drag was too light, coming immediately
to the surface and drifting down to leeward, holding
us not at all. We yawed badly, shipping water over both
sides in spite of all our two oars and the rudder could do
to hold us bows on, and, as expected, Jack Cole immediately
piped up with,</p>

<p>“Shure, Mr. Melville, I tould yez so!”</p>

<p>“Right, Jack; you did!” I shouted. “And now we’ll fix it.
Bartlett! Send down that fire-pot!” Bartlett, again on his feet
seized the copper fire-pot and sent it sliding on a lashing out
over the bow and down the anchor line to the drag, which
it promptly sank. A heavy strain came immediately on the
drag line as the sea anchor gripped the water and in a few
seconds we were riding head to the seas with our oars in,
our weathercloths once more raised on our bulwarks, our
sail furled, and the helmsman, as before, continuously steering
to keep us from yawing on the drag line.</p>

<p>My thumping heart quieted somewhat. Dan had done a
fine job. We had come about without capsizing and for the
moment we were safe. All we had to do now was to bail
continuously to keep afloat, but so long as our drag line held,
we were secure. But as much vigilance as ever was necessary,
for if that line parted, and we went adrift, unless we were
immediately ready with the oars, our first yaw would probably
also be our last one.</p>

<p>By now it was ten o’clock and pitch dark. All through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
the rest of that terrible night we tossed violently at the end
of our sea anchor line, bailing, always bailing. My hands
were swollen by cold, blistered from hanging on to the sheet
while we sailed, and cracked and split by freezing salt water,
while my feet were both badly frozen. Leach, who for
the first time I now dared to relieve from his station at the
tiller, was as badly off as I, and the rest of the crew, not
much better. And now thirst was added to our sufferings,
for we had not a drop of fresh water, every bit of snow
that originally we had in the boat in our pots and kettles
having long since been thoroughly soused in sea water and
spoiled.</p>

<p>The gale shrieked on, the waves rolled by, the cold spray
dashed in and froze on us, and in the darkness wearily and
endlessly we bailed the boat till at last came dawn to put
the final touch to our misery by adding to each man’s sense
of his own suffering the sight of his shipmates’ wretched
state.</p>

<p>Cold, thirsty, and hungry after twelve excruciating hours
of bailing, my exhausted crew looked expectantly at me for
their rations. In the boat, there was nothing left in the way
of food or drink but a little pemmican.</p>

<p>Sadly I recalled Chipp’s last remark about his being
through with pemmican, only a jest when made, tragic now.
Poor Chipp! Pemmican, in truth, meant nothing to him any
more. If only I had him and his second cutter’s crew following
astern of me again, how gladly would I divide my
meager supply of pemmican with them! Mournfully I
looked at our tiny stock. At the previous miserly rate of
issue, it should last us five days, but no longer did I dare
to hope that Cape Barkin and rescue were just over the
horizon. Heaven alone knew where, drifting at the mercy
of wind and wave, we would be when the gale blew out. I
must stretch our food to the utmost. So in spite of grumbling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
from my ravenous crew, I cut our already short ration
squarely in half and issued for our breakfast so small a piece
of pemmican that not a man, after swallowing his ration at
a gulp, but growled for more.</p>

<p>At the end of that sea anchor line, our whaleboat weaved,
twisted, and leaped erratically about amongst the foaming
waves, more terrifying now that we could see the thundering
crests sweeping down and breaking over us, than even in the
darkness. Monotonously we bailed; Aneguin, our Indian
hunter, and Charley Tong Sing, our Chinese steward,
strangely enough proving far more dextrous with the bailing
pots than any sailor in the boat. Almost helpless myself,
with numbed hands and frozen feet from long hours of hanging
on to the sheet, I watched forward while the endless
task went on, keeping a weary eye on that thin manila line
going over our bow to our sea anchor, that thread to which
our boat rode head to the gale, our life line indeed.</p>

<p>And then mixed with the screaming of the winds, I caught
a burst of laughter. Laughter? I could hardly believe my ears.
What in God’s name could anyone see in our situation that
was funny? Painfully I twisted my ice-sheathed body round
on the thwart to see, and then I groaned. On the midship
thwart sat Jack Cole no longer bailing, a maniacal gleam in
his eyes, rocking with childish glee in the spray of each
wave as it broke over the weathercloth and poured in on
him, laughing, laughing horribly. Jack Cole, our bosun, like
a little child was splashing playfully in the water!</p>

<p>Like a flash there came over me an understanding of
Cole’s apathy and inexplicable stupidity during the last few
days. His mind had evidently been going then; now after the
horrors of the night, it was completely gone!</p>

<p>That terrible laughter must not continue. With my whole
crew near the breaking point, a little more of that insane
shrieking in the storm and I would have only a boat-load of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
lunatics to depend on, if indeed I did not soon become one
myself. I dragged aft a bit, took Cole gently by the hand.</p>

<p>“Come on, Jack,” I said kindly, “let’s go forward where
we can see the waves better and I can help you watch them.”</p>

<p>Jack stopped laughing, looked blankly at me, but offered
no resistance and together we dragged our frozen legs over
the thwarts to the bow. There, smiling happily, Jack started
laughing again as a terrific sea broke dead on our stem,
nearly drowning me in foaming water.</p>

<p>In the midst of that insane cackle, I grabbed Cole suddenly
by both shoulders, pushed him heavily down beneath
the thwart and shoved him in under the canvas-covered
forecastle forward of our mast, where at least the canvas
would muffle that ghastly laugh.</p>

<p>“Take a nap now, old fellow,” I said soothingly as possible.
“You’re tired!”</p>

<p>“Shure an’ I am that,” mumbled Cole from beneath the
canvas. “But ye’ll not be fergittin’ to call me agin soon so’s
we kin watch thim waves?”</p>

<p>“No, Jack, I won’t,” I promised. “Just as soon as you’re
rested.”</p>

<p>Without another word, Jack, half covered with the icy
water sloshing about in the bilges, went dead to the world,
and I, turning wanly from the gale, sagged back against the
mast, staring at the haggard men in the boat abaft me bailing,
bailing, while the never-ending waves foamed up and
broke sickeningly over our bow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">After four harrowing days in the whaleboat, the first two
in the gale, the second two fighting our way through offshore
shoals in the open ocean, we finally sighted land.
Hungry, thirsty, frozen, we gazed as hopefully across the
sea at two low headlands barely showing above the horizon
as though they were the very gates of Heaven. Under oars,
for the wind at last had died away, we propelled our boat
toward them, and soon found ourselves between two low
hills apparently forming the mouth of a wide and muddy
river running swiftly out into the sea. All hands leaned over
the gunwales, and finding the water sweet, we drank greedily,
regardless of mud, regardless of everything.</p>

<p>Where were we? Neither Danenhower nor I knew, but
as that low and barren coast trended north and south, I assumed
we were on the eastern side of the Lena Delta, how
far south of Cape Barkin I could not tell. But at least we
had Siberia at last before us! My orders directed me to land
at Cape Barkin, where I should find native huts, but I had
had enough of the Arctic Sea for the present and for the future,
and with Barkin an unknown distance up an unknown
coast, I decided to be satisfied with the land I could see and
proceed up the river before me till I located some village
there. So in spite of Danenhower’s objections to my course,
we rowed (that is, if the feeble efforts of the half-dead sailors
manning the oars could be called rowing) up the broad
river, constantly attempting to make a landing on either
bank, but always baffled by shoals which prevented us from
getting within a hundred yards of those flat and muddy
shores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span></p>

<p>Finally in the late evening after a gruelling day at the oars,
we spotted on one bank an abandoned hut, before which was
a cove into which we made our way thankfully, and for the
first time in five days landed to stretch our legs. I found that
I could hardly move mine; most of my men were in like
case. Only Danenhower, whose blindness had excused him
from bailing, and Newcomb, who had most successfully
evaded it, had managed to keep their legs in shape so that
they could walk. The rest of us had practically to crawl
from the boat.</p>

<p>Thinking to warm up and thaw out our blackened and
frost-bitten feet, we gathered driftwood, made a fire in the
hut, and huddled round it, stretched on the ground, with
our numbed feet toward the fire. But instead of helping,
agonizing pains started to shoot from my paralyzed feet as
soon as the heat took effect, so stripping my legs for examination,
I found they were frozen from the knees down, terribly
swollen, covered with cracks, blisters, and sores all run
together, and with the skin sloughing off at the slightest
touch. Excruciating pain instead of sleep was my portion
our first night ashore, and in place of the eagerly awaited
comfort which we had looked forward to in Siberia, most
of us writhed in pain, suffering the tortures of the damned.</p>

<p>At dawn, after a slim portion of pemmican washed down
with muddy tea, we launched our boat and set bravely out
up the river to find a village, only to discover instead that
we were in a desolate maze of shoals, swamps, and muddy
islands forming the delta, with rivers, sometimes swift and
sometimes sluggish, crisscrossing erratically as they flowed
over the low delta lands to the sea. Young ice was forming
everywhere over river and swamp and through it with boathooks
and oars we had to smash a way for our bow. Three
days of this we had to endure alternating between slaving at
the oars during the day and freezing at night in our camps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
on the barren mud flats, while both night and day we starved
on scanty rations, and I finally began to despair of rescue.
Here we were on the Lena Delta, but of the many villages
indicated on Petermann’s charts, we could find no sign.
Never a native did we see, and the few huts we spotted now
and then were all abandoned, their owners having already
retreated southward before the oncoming winter which was
rapidly robbing us of what little vitality remained in our
feeble bodies. Were we never to escape? Were all our sufferings
to end only in our deaths in the delta? Had we not already
borne enough since those harrowing years on the
<em>Jeannette</em> to be spared that? First the torture of dragging
boats and sledges over the pack, then the horrors of navigating
amidst the streaming ice of the New Siberian Archipelago,
finally that four-day nightmare of tumbling waves
and freezing spray in the open whaleboat battling an Arctic
gale—was all this not enough? Yet through all our trials
since the loss of the <em>Jeannette</em> we had been sustained by the
thought that if only we held out till we reached the Lena
Delta, there at last our sufferings would end, amid friendly
natives we would find food, shelter, and transportation home.</p>

<p>How different now was the reality! The Lena Delta we
found a bleak and barren tundra, empty of game, as inhospitable
and as desolate as that ice pack in which for two
years we had drifted in the long-lost <em>Jeannette</em>. Our dream
of a safe haven had exploded in our faces. With food gone,
men worn out, and worst of all, the hope which had driven
us all to superhuman labor proved a lie, our situation was
desperate beyond conception. Bitterly we cursed Petermann
and all his works, which had led us astray.</p>

<p>But there was nothing to do save to move on, working
always toward the headwaters of the delta as long as we
could swing the oars, so for the fourth day in succession,
we shoved off from a mudflat camp, broke our way through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
new ice, and I pushed my men (whose arms fortunately
were a little better off than their legs) upstream toward the
delta head.</p>

<p>And then, thank God, in the middle of this day, while
deadened arms and stupefied bodies swung wearily over the
oars, we suddenly sighted three natives in kyacks shoot out
from behind a bend in the swamp!</p>

<p>Like drowning men grasping at straws, we waved to them,
shouted to them, and tried to row to them, but before the
apparition of a strange boat in their waters, they were shy
and afraid, and not till I held up our last tiny strip of pemmican
did I entice one, more curious than his comrades, close
aboard us to taste the strange meat. Then like the jaws of
a trap closing on its victim, we grabbed his kyack before
he could dart away!</p>

<p>Badly frightened, the fur-clad native attempted to escape,
but we would sooner have released our only hope of salvation
than our grip on that poor Yakut who represented now
our last slim chance to avoid perishing in the maze of that
frozen delta, and we held to him like grim death. Gradually
I calmed his fears, gave him the pemmican, endeavored in
pantomime to show him we were friendly, and at last holding
to him while we beached our whaleboat, convinced him
of our good intentions by giving him a little of the trifling
quantity of alcohol we had left for our stove.</p>

<p>The alcohol settled the question. He promptly hailed his
two comrades standing warily off in their kyacks, and soon
all three of the natives, warming up on pure grain alcohol,
were our bosom friends. In exchange for the alcohol, they
gave us some fish and a goose out of which mixture we
promptly made a stew which we wolfed down ravenously.
And then with pencil sketches and gestures, I endeavored
to make plain that I wanted them to guide us to a village,
and specifically to Bulun, the largest town shown on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
chart, some sixty miles up the Lena River from the head
of the delta.</p>

<p>It was remarkable how, understanding not one word of
each other’s language, we got along. The three Yakuts indicated
we could not get to Bulun on account of ice in the
river, that we should all die on the way. However, they
made plain that another Yakut village, Jamaveloch, they
could take us to, and next day for Jamaveloch we started.
But so tortuous was the course and so hard the labor in
working our boat through the delta swamps and rivers, that
not till a week later did we finally, on September 26th, two
weeks after the gale, arrive at Jamaveloch. Had it not been
for the food provided by our guides as well as for their
pilotage, it is inconceivable that we should ever have arrived
alive at this village at the southeastern corner of the delta,
seventy miles from Cape Barkin, and the only inhabited village
for over a hundred and fifty miles in either direction
along the Siberian Coast! Had we gone to Barkin, we should
assuredly have perished, for there, the natives told us, Petermann
was absolutely wrong—there were no villages, no lighthouses,
no inhabitants of any kind there, nothing but a barren
coast.</p>

<p>But Jamaveloch itself was not very promising as a haven
except for a brief stay. It had but six huts and a few small
storehouses, not over fifteen adult inhabitants, and no great
surplus of food. Doubtful that its scant supply of fish and
geese would long take care of eleven voracious seamen
thrown unexpectedly on the resources of so small a community,
I decided after one night at Jamaveloch to push on
in our whaleboat up the south branch of the Lena to Bulun,
a hundred and ten miles away by land but a hundred and
fifty miles distant up the winding river. Strenuously in their
native Yakut tongue (some of which I had now picked up)
the villagers and especially their headman, Nicolai Chagra,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
objected that ice in the river would block us and leave us
to perish along the uninhabited river banks, but I persisted.
So accompanied once more by my original native pilots, I
loaded my sick crew into the whaleboat, took aboard sixty
dried fish (all I could get) for supplies from Nicolai, and
we started. In an hour we were back. Nicolai Chagra was
right. The <em>Jeannette</em> herself could not have plowed through
the ice, alternately freezing and breaking loose in the river,
which swept downstream in the current, effectively blocking
any progress toward Bulun.</p>

<p>Willing or not, there was no choice but to stay at Jamaveloch.
Unable to walk, I crawled from the whaleboat and
was hauled on a sledge from the shore to a hut turned over
to us by Nicolai; Leach, with the flesh falling from his
frozen toes, was hauled up on another sledge; and most of
the rest of my crew in the remnants of their tattered clothes,
crawled or hobbled after us.</p>

<p>For two and a half weeks we lay in that hut, slowly recuperating
from our frostbites, subsisting mainly on a slim
ration of fish given us daily by the Yakut villagers, and
thinking up weird schemes of getting away to Bulun. But till
the rivers froze solidly enough to sledge over the ice, there
was no chance. Even then, the limited facilities of the village
could never provide the necessary sledges for eleven
men nor the clothes to keep us from freezing in the sub-zero
weather which October had brought. But get away soon we
must, for all the flesh had sloughed from several of Leach’s
toes and he needed medical attention badly if he were not
soon to die; while Cole, lucid at intervals, required expert
care also if his mind were to be saved; and Danenhower’s
eye, a month now without surgical care, was beginning to relapse.
As for the rest of us, our legs were getting better and
we could soon drag ourselves about, but the food problem
was rapidly getting acute, and I was very much afraid that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
we should awake some morning to discover that the natives,
finding us too much of a drain on their stores, had silently
moved on in the night to some other collection of vacant huts
of which we knew nothing, leaving us to starve alone lest
everyone starve together.</p>

<p>The only solution to this dilemma, since we could not go
to Bulun, was to have Bulun send us the necessary dog teams,
sledges, clothes, and food to make the journey. How to get
word to Bulun, however, was the difficulty, for none of the
natives would go and no man in my party knew the road
over the distant mountains to Bulun. I dared send no one
without a guide.</p>

<p>The reason given by the natives for refusing to undertake
the trip was that it was an impossible season for traveling,
an in-between time in which they could safely move
neither by boat nor sledge. A few weeks before, in early
September, it would have been possible to go by boat but
now new ice forming everywhere prevented. A few weeks
later, it would be possible to travel by sledge cross-country
over snow and ice, but just now that also could not be attempted
for the ice on the many rivers to be crossed was
continuously breaking in the current and was nowhere yet
thick enough to bear the weight of a sledge without grave
danger of crashing through into the river and losing sledge
and dogs at least, if not drivers also. To all our entreaties,
Nicolai Chagra merely shrugged his shoulders—early September,
yes; late October, yes; but now, a most decided no!</p>

<p>Providentially the matter was settled for us about the
middle of October by the chance visit to the village of a
Russian exile, Kusmah by name, who lived nearby and who
on the promise of the whaleboat immediately and five hundred
roubles later (when I could get funds from America)
undertook to make the dangerous journey and started off
with his dog sledge over the frozen tundra to Bulun, expecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
to return in five days.</p>

<p>Vaguely, while he was gone, we speculated on how long
it would take us to sledge the fifteen hundred miles from
Bulun via Yakutsk to Irkutsk on Lake Baikal, and then via
post road get to Moscow and so home. And while we speculated
over that, we also speculated earnestly over the fate of
De Long and the first cutter. There was no doubt that his
boat had followed Chipp’s, but over the question of how
long the first cutter had lasted in the gale and whether she
had come to her doom finally by capsizing or by swamping,
there was many a hot discussion, as my seamen argued vehemently
over the relative probabilities of a square-sterned
boat like the heavily-built first cutter broaching before she
flooded, or vice versa. The consensus of opinion was that
she had swamped, for De Long had in his boat not only
three more men than we, but also Snoozer, the last dog, all
the navigating equipment, four rifles, the complete records
of the expedition in ten cases, and one small sledge which
De Long had kept to drag the records on. With so much
ballast in his boat, that his men could have bailed fast enough
to avoid foundering seemed incredible to most of us after
our own experiences with the much lighter double-ended
whaleboat, but the broaching theorists would never agree to
it. Chipp, whom all hands freely admitted was the best sailor,
had broached and capsized. How then could De Long have
avoided it? And since, crowded in our little hut with nothing
else to do, there was no outlet for men too feeble to
get about save in talk, the argument went on endlessly, and
of course with no chance of an agreement ever being
reached.</p>

<p>Five days went by and Kusmah, our messenger to Bulun,
had not returned. Ten days elapsed and we became alarmed
for Kusmah. Had he perished in the ice? To add to our worries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
Nicolai Chagra cut our food supply from four fish a
day to three, with occasionally a putrid and decaying goose
supplied in lieu of the fish.</p>

<p>I was seriously debating sending Bartlett, the strongest
member of our party, on to Bulun in the forlorn hope of
getting us assistance, when on the night of October 29th,
after thirteen days’ absence on his hazardous journey, Kusmah
at last returned, bringing on his sledge some supplies,
about forty pounds of bread mainly, and no clothes for us,
but instead a letter in Russian from the Cossack commandant
at Bulun stating that next day he would start for us from
there with a reindeer caravan and clothes enough to bring
us all safely over the mountains to Bulun.</p>

<p>This news heartened us considerably, and in broken Russian
I profusely thanked Kusmah. Meanwhile my men, not
waiting to thank anybody, were revelling in the bread of
which we had seen none for nearly five months, breaking
the loaves in huge chunks into which they sank their teeth
hungrily. All smiles at my expressions of approbation, and
happy at the way everyone seemed to appreciate what food
he had brought us, Kusmah bowed, then pulled from inside
his fur jacket a dirty scrap of paper which he tendered me.
On it was a pencilled message. Pausing casually between two
mouthfuls of bread, I glanced at it, noted in surprise that it
was in English, and then as I read the first words, I stiffened
as suddenly as if I had been shot.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Arctic steamer <em>Jeannette</em> lost on the 11th June; landed
on Siberia 25th September or thereabouts; want assistance
to go for the <span class="allsmcap">CAPTAIN</span> and <span class="allsmcap">DOCTOR</span> and nine (9) other men.</p>

</p>

<p class="no-indent"><em>Reply in haste; want food and clothing.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span></p>

<p>For a moment my heart stopped beating as I read, then I
called out huskily,</p>

<p>“Men! De Long and the first cutter landed safely! They’re
alive!”</p>

<p>All over the hut broken loaves of bread thudded to the
floor as open-mouthed in astonishment at this startling declaration,
my shipmates stared at me, then clustered round to
read the note, while I turned abruptly to Kusmah, asked in
my best Russian,</p>

<p>“That note, Kusmah! Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>With some difficulty, Kusmah explained to me his trip.
To get to Bulun, he had to go fifty miles due west cross
country over the mountains to Ku Mark Surk on the Lena
River (where he was delayed a week waiting for the main
stream to freeze over so he could cross) and then sixty miles
due south along the west bank of the Lena to Bulun. On his
way back to us from Bulun, coming again to Ku Mark Surk,
he had met there a small reindeer caravan of Yakuts bound
south for Bulun and with that caravan, clad only in tattered
underwear and sick almost to death, he had come across two
strangers feebly expostulating with the natives against going
south and almost hysterical at their inability to make themselves
understood.</p>

<p>He spoke to them in Russian, with no better luck at communication
than the Yakut reindeer drivers had had, but
suddenly recalling what we had told him of our two lost
boats, he enquired of them,</p>

<p>“<em>Jeannette? Americanski?</em>” and immediately the men had
understood, nodding vigorously in assent; and writing this
note, had placed it in his hands, begging him piteously,</p>

<p>“<em>Commandant! Bulun! Bulun!</em>”</p>

<p>That he understood also, but as he was bound for Jamaveloch
and knew that I would be most interested in the matter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
he had forthwith resumed his journey, and now, two
days later, there was the message in my hands, while Nindemann
and Noros no doubt were by this time in Bulun itself.</p>

<p>I retrieved the note from Bartlett and read it again carefully.
De Long had landed, but simply “on Siberia.” Where
was he now? The note was blank on that. I could not tell.
But evidently he was in a bad way, for Nindemann and
Noros, somehow separated from their shipmates, were from
Kusmah’s account obviously far gone, and as for the others,
that closing scrawl,</p>

<p>“<em>Reply in haste; want food and clothing</em>” had an ominous
ring. And then my eyes fell again on “the <span class="allsmcap">CAPTAIN</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">DOCTOR</span> and nine (9) other men.”</p>

<p>Nine? Hastily I counted up. The captain, the doctor,
Nindemann, Noros and nine others—that made only thirteen!
But De Long had had fourteen all told in his boat!
Was nine an error? No; as if to emphasize it, the <em>nine</em> was
repeated as a figure in parenthesis. So already one of De
Long’s party had died. Sadly I wondered who. Collins, perhaps?
No, I decided; Collins had done no work on the ice
to wear him down. Lee, my machinist, was most likely, I
concluded. His injured hips would have made it most difficult
for him to keep up and he might have had to be left
behind.</p>

<p>But this was no time for wondering. Only Nindemann and
Noros could tell me where the captain was and how to get
there. And if those two men were as badly off as Kusmah
said, they might both soon die, taking their secret with them.
The Lena Delta was large, over 5000 square miles in area,
and from bitter experience I knew now how difficult it was
to find one’s way amidst its myriad islands, swamps, and
freezing streams. And as for charts, there were none worthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
of the name—Petermann’s, which had nearly led my party to
starvation, was worse than useless. I shivered as I thought of
that. De Long, relying on that same Petermann chart, had
intended to land near Barkin! Barkin and the north coast of
the delta thereabouts, were not only uninhabited and a hopeless
stretch of barren tundra, but a hundred miles further
north and by so much further removed even from such
slight shelter as we had providentially encountered at Jamaveloch!
De Long and his party must be in fearful straits!</p>

<p>“Kusmah!” I said sharply. “Return with me to Bulun at
once! Get your dogs! We start right away!”</p>

<p>But Kusmah demurred, objecting that his dog team was
completely worn out and could not travel the ice again
without several days’ rest. On investigating his dogs, this
proved to be true, so getting hold promptly of Nicolai
Chagra, I insisted vigorously that he provide immediately
from somewhere another team if it stripped the village of
its last dog.</p>

<p>Chagra was willing enough, but it took him all night to
scrape up the necessary dogs, and not till next morning,
October 30th (a day which later became indelibly burned
into my memory), behind a team of eleven dogs driven by
my original Yakut pilot, did I set off in a temperature twenty
degrees below zero for Bulun where from Nindemann and
Noros I hoped to learn of De Long’s whereabouts. Two days
later, after hard labor by the dogs through deep snow and
over broken ice, I was at Ku Mark Surk, where I changed
my worn-out dog team for a reindeer sledge, and with that
made the last sixty miles southward up the frozen Lena to
Bulun, arriving on the evening of November 2.</p>

<p>I promptly enquired my way to the hut where were
lodged Nindemann and Noros, and in mingled fear and hope
hurried there. What was I going to hear of my captain, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
Dr. Ambler, about my other shipmates? Which one of them
was already dead, what chance had I of rescuing the survivors?
With my heart pounding violently, I pushed open
the door of the hut.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">In the smoky light of the rude interior of that Yakut hut,
I saw at first only Louis Noros, clothed in ragged woolen
underwear, bending over a rough table, sawing away with
his sheath knife on a loaf of hard black bread, while in a
corner by themselves a number of Yakuts were busy over
the fire on their own supper. Noros glanced up on my entrance,
looked at me vacantly, and then resumed his hacking
at the hard bread. I waited a moment to see if he might
recognize me, but as he did not, I advanced, stretched out
my hand, and said,</p>

<p>“Hello, Noros! Don’t you know me?”</p>

<p>Startled at being addressed in English, Noros dropped his
knife, peered intently in my face, and then fell on my neck,
sobbing,</p>

<p>“My God, Mr. Melville, are <em>you</em> alive?”</p>

<p>At this outburst, through the smoky room I saw Nindemann
suddenly lift himself on one elbow from a rough
couch at the side and cry out brokenly,</p>

<p>“Mr. Melville! We thought you were dead! That all
hands on the <em>Jeannette</em> were dead except me and Noros!
Louis and me thought we were the only survivors—we were
sure the whaleboat’s were all drowned as well as the second
cutter’s!”</p>

<p>Bending over Nindemann, too far gone to lift himself,
while Noros clung round my shoulders, I wept with them.</p>

<p>“No, boys,” I said gently, “the whole whaleboat’s crew
is safe. And they’re all overjoyed to know that you are too.
But who died in your boat, and where, for God’s sake, are
the skipper and the rest of your boat’s crew? I’ll go for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
them right away.”</p>

<p>“No use! They must be all gone by now!” sobbed out
Nindemann feebly. “Over three weeks ago, October 9th,
the captain sent me and Louis south to look for help, and
they were nearly dead then; no food for seven days and
everybody frozen bad. We struggled to the south along the
river and were no more able even to crawl and nearly dead
ourselves when the natives found us twelve days after and
carried us here.” Nindemann’s choking voice broke hysterically.
“Mr. Melville, we didn’t want to come here, we
wanted them to take us back! But we couldn’t make anybody
understand about the captain. And he was dying then.
Now it’s too late!” and falling back on his wooden couch,
Nindemann wept like a baby in my lap.</p>

<p>“Where are they now?” I asked sadly. “I’ll find them!
Tell me; what happened, boys?” and as I listened, the tears
streamed down my roughened cheeks as between them,
Noros and Nindemann poured out the story of the first
cutter and its crew.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Before the steadily rising Arctic gale, the <em>Jeannette’s</em> three
boats in broken formation were scattering in the storm.
Dismayed at this sight, De Long who had the only navigating
outfit in the flotilla and in addition was carrying all Chipp’s
meager food supply, rose in the sternsheets of his cutter and
waved vigorously to the other boats to get back in position
astern of him. But seeing the whaleboat nearly swamp attempting
to drop back, he signalled her on.</p>

<p>Taking a second reef in his own sail to deaden still further
his speed, De Long continued waving to Chipp, hopeful
at least of getting him close enough aboard to toss over his
can of pemmican before in the storm and the night, he
lost him to view. Badly flooded himself by oncoming seas,
he nevertheless held back, till Chipp and his boat, suddenly
engulfed in the waves, disappeared forever from sight.</p>

<p>Sadly then, De Long shook out one reef and picking
up headway, stood away dead before the wind, heading
southwest for Barkin. Blonde and bearded Erichsen, tall and
brawny, a sailor from his childhood in far-off Denmark and
in stature a royal Dane indeed, the best seaman in the boat,
steered. Crowded into the cockpit before him were De Long,
Ambler, and Collins, while forward of them on each side
of the boat, backs to the weather cloths holding them up
against the sea, were the rest of the crew—Nindemann, the
quartermaster, tending the sheet, Lee, Kaack, Noros, Görtz,
Dressler, Iversen, Alexey, Ah Sam, and Boyd. Jammed under
the thwarts, practically filling all the spaces there were the
sledge, the tin cases containing the <em>Jeannette’s</em> records, the
navigating gear, the silken ensign in its oilskin case, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
rifles, tents, sleeping bags, cooking pots, and a few cans of
pemmican, with Snoozer, the last Eskimo dog, crouching
on the sleeping bags and whimpering piteously as the spray
soaked him.</p>

<p>The heavily-laden first cutter, only twenty feet long but
wider of beam than any other of the <em>Jeannette’s</em> boats and
with all that ballast on her bottom, therefore more stable
and more resistant to capsizing than either of the other two,
lumbered on before the wind, pitching heavily as the curling
seas swept up under her square stern, and yawing badly in
spite of all that Erichsen at the tiller could do to hold her
on her course. Darkness fell, the seas grew worse, the crew
bailed steadily.</p>

<p>Twice the boat yawed suddenly and the sail jibed violently,
straining the mast, but each time Erichsen managed
to catch her and the yard and sail were again squared and
the boat stood on with the wind screaming by and the
merciless seas breaking heavily over the stern, soaking Erichsen
continuously and spraying everyone else with freezing
water.</p>

<p>For an hour the boat stood on before the storm with the
water coming in over both sides and the stern, while her
crew bailed vigorously to keep up with it. And then, riding
on the crest of a tremendous wave roaring up astern, came
disaster. The boat took a bad yaw as the sea struck, the
stern swung off to port with the crest. Immediately the sail,
caught flat aback by the wind, jibed over and the yard
banged viciously round to leeward, heeling the boat sharply
down on her port side and riding the lee gunwale completely
under! Instantly solid water came pouring in over the submerged
rail. In another split second, the half-capsized cutter
would have been bottom up with her crew spilled into the
raging seas, had not at that instant the mast, already
weakened by the previous jibes, broken clean off, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
the flapping sail shot overboard, momentarily relieving the
fatal strain!</p>

<p>For one horrible second, the listing boat hung with her
gunwale under, poised uncertainly between going completely
over and rolling back, while her agonized crew,
clinging desperately to the thwarts to avoid being tossed out,
felt cold death in the form of the inrushing water lapping
round their bodies! Then slowly, very slowly, under the
influence of the heavy ballast jammed along the bottom
boards, the dismasted cutter rolled back on an even keel,
awash to the thwarts and so deep in the water that her
gunwales barely showed above the foaming surface!</p>

<p>“Bail!” roared De Long. “All hands! Bail!”</p>

<p>A waterlogged wreck, the first cutter lay broadside in the
trough of the sea with every man in her buried in salt water
to his waist, frenziedly bailing to regain a semblance of
buoyancy before the next wave swept over her side and
finished her. Fortunately at that instant, the broken mast
and the ballooning sail, dragging alongside by the halliards
streaming over the bow, caught the water, began acting as
a sea anchor, and the startled men in the boat, too busy
bailing to lift a hand for any other purpose, saw in amazement
their submerged cutter swing slowly round in the
trough into the wind and sluggishly rise head on to the next
crest, heaving herself to!</p>

<p>Had even another moderate sea swept up at this moment,
the boat would unquestionably have finished filling and
foundered, but by some freak of the storm, only a succession
of lazy billows came rolling by until with the boat half-emptied
and higher in the water, De Long could get out
some oars to hold her steady the while he sent Görtz and
Kaack racing forward to clear away the wreckage.</p>

<p>Holding his cutter head on with oars and rudder while
he finished bailing and dragged in the impromptu sea anchor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
by the halliards, the captain hastily made a drag of his sail
only and an empty water breaker to hold it up, and then
rode the gale to that, taking in the oars and raising the
weathercloths again, while Erichsen, still clinging to the
tiller, steered into the wind and the rest of the crew bailed
to keep afloat.</p>

<p>For the men crowded in the boat, it was a night of utter
misery and terror, wet through, freezing in the gale, tossing
madly in the cutter, and with Collins slumped in the cockpit
too weak or too heedless to reach the rail, violently and
continuously seasick to add the final touch.</p>

<p>At midnight their sea anchor carried suddenly away and
with it went the sail. Instantly out went a pair of oars to
hold her up, while another drag, made of the broken mast
and the rest of the oars, with the expedition’s solitary pick-ax
hung to it to hold it down, was sent out over the bow.
This proved a poor substitute for the sail, for having insufficient
surface, it failed to catch the water properly and
rode off the cutter’s beam, instead of ahead, with the result
that the boat, no longer bows-on to the waves, wallowed
in the troughs and rolled horribly, making water worse than
ever.</p>

<p>After thirty-six hours of this torture, the gale finally
abated, and with only a fresh breeze and a heavy sea still
running, De Long prepared again to get underway, but he
had no sail. Nindemann searched the boat for substitutes;
out of a hammock and the sledge cover, sewed together by
Görtz and Kaack, Nindemann provided a jury sail. The
drag was hauled in to recover the mast; with a chisel, Nindemann
refitted the broken end of the mast to its step, rerigged
it, and soon with the two insignificant bits of canvas spread
at the yard, the first cutter resumed her journey for the
Lena Delta, making hardly one knot through the water, and
because the breeze had now hauled to the south, unable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
sail closer to the wind than a course due west instead of
the desired southwest.</p>

<p>But what the course should be to make Cape Barkin and
where the boat was, God alone knew. It was impossible to
get a sight, and even had it not been, De Long’s hands were
so badly frozen he could not work his sextant. So willy-nilly,
the boat went west for two days with De Long and his
frozen crew, barely crawling along under the tiny jury rig,
till early on the morning of September 16th, having been
four days at sea since leaving Semenovski Island, the wind
failed altogether, and in a dead calm sea, De Long ordered
out the oars and headed due south, feeling that he had made
more than enough westing.</p>

<p>By this time, from long-continued watchfulness and exposure,
both De Long’s hands and his feet were so badly
frozen and had swollen to such size that he was wholly unable
to move himself. Tenderly Dr. Ambler got out his
soaked sleeping bag, and helped by Görtz, slipped the captain
into it and then propped him up in the sternsheets so
he could see to maneuver the boat.</p>

<p>After a few hours of rowing south, the water began to
shoal rapidly and the cutter ran into a skim of young ice,
through which it broke its way. Soon low-lying land was
sighted to the south, undoubtedly some part of the northern
side of the Lena Delta. With redoubled energy the men
heaved with their cracked and bleeding hands at the oars,
driving through thickening ice toward the coast. A little
to starboard an open lead in the young ice was sighted, seemingly
running inshore toward a river mouth, and into this
lead the boat was rammed through the intervening ice, keeping
on in this open water till at about 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, still more than
a mile offshore, the boat grounded solidly in less than two
feet of water with new ice freezing constantly all about her
in the bitter cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span></p>

<p>After a fruitless effort to get inshore through the invisible
shoals, De Long tried to work out again to the northward,
hoping then to go further west and perhaps find a better
channel into the river, which so far as could be judged
from the width between the headlands, seemed to be one
of the main northern mouths of the Lena. But the thickening
ice had closed in behind, and stuck fast in the hidden shoal,
the boat could be moved neither ahead nor astern with the
oars.</p>

<p>De Long after a futile effort to push out, using the oars
as poles, became desperate.</p>

<p>“All hands over the side to lighten the boat!” he ordered.
“We’ll push her off!”</p>

<p>Silently, all except the helmsman, the men started to obey,
but first began to remove their wet boots, not wishing to
fill them with mud. Off came the worn and leaking footgear,
exposing to view badly swollen feet, many already black
with frostbite and with blisters breaking as the skin, stuck
to the boots, tore away from the frozen flesh. Dr. Ambler
took one swift glance at them, then leaning over the helpless
captain, whispered in his ear. De Long bent forward, looked
himself, then said,</p>

<p>“Belay going over the side, men. Put on your boots. We’ll
try shoving her off again with the oars instead.”</p>

<p>But the enfeebled seamen had little luck. An all day
struggle with the shallow water moved the boat hardly a
hundred yards, and night fell on an exhausted boat crew,
caught amidst ice and shoals, unable either to get the cutter
ashore or get it to sea.</p>

<p>Once more they spent a cheerless night in the cramped
boat, tantalized by that unapproachable shore a mile and a
half away, unable to sleep, wet, freezing, and thirsty on
the crowded thwarts.</p>

<p>At daybreak, they tried again. Managing to get free of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
the ice and the mud, they made a few yards, only to ground
on another shoal. Getting clear of that, the ice soon blocked
them. It made little difference which way they headed, north
or south, east or west, shoals and young ice were everywhere.
Bitterly De Long looked from his heavy cutter and
his fast-fading men across a mile and a half of thin ice,
strong enough to block the boat, too weak to sustain a man,
toward the low coast of Siberia. It was three o’clock in the
afternoon. He would never get the boat free—eight hours of
labor today on top of all of yesterday and no progress made
either toward shore or toward sea and nothing to look forward
to now except another terrible night in the boat in the
fierce cold.</p>

<p>De Long made up his mind. Regardless of their condition,
they must abandon the cutter, wade ashore. He still had
two hours of daylight in which to work, and despite frost-bitten
feet, there was no alternative; into that icy water they
must plunge. But three of the men, Boyd, Erichsen, and
himself, hardly able to stand without toppling headlong,
could never make that mile and a half wading through ice
and shoals to the land. They would have to get the boat
closer first.</p>

<p>“Except the sick and the doctor, all hands over the side!
We’re going to abandon the boat and wade ashore! Keep
your boots on this time, men!”</p>

<p>Slowly the rest of the crew crawled over the side into
the water, finding it knee deep. Leaving in the boat only
the four men and Snoozer, and taking as heavy a load on
his back as each could carry, the crew set out for shore,
Nindemann first to break a path through the half inch ice,
then in succession Kaack, Görtz, Iversen, Lee, Dressler, Collins,
Alexey, Noros, and finally Ah Sam, whose feet were
in such bad shape that not to impede the others he was ordered
to go last. It was hard work, especially for Nindemann<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
smashing ahead through the ice, with the chilly water
changing irregularly in depth from knee deep to over his
waist, sinking unexpectedly into mudholes from which he
could hardly drag his feet, and all the while pounding away
at the sheet ice with hips and thighs, unable to use his arms
because of the load on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Finally the panting quartermaster reached the shore, a
low and swampy slope. Behind him trudged the others, and
thankfully coming up out of the sea, squeezing mud and
slush from their boots at every step, they dumped their
loads on the beach. Siberia at last! A feeble cheer burst from
husky throats and cracking lips.</p>

<p>But looking round at that dismal shore, covered with
snow, bare of all vegetation, utterly desolate and devoid of
any trace of human habitation then or ever, it is doubtful
that there could have been found on earth any group of
human beings save only these few who had gone through
hell on ice to reach that shore, who would not have cursed
instead of cheered at setting foot on that bleak tundra.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">“Come on, boys; we go back now for the rest of the load
and the captain,” ordered Nindemann, who with his rating
of quartermaster was senior in the group ashore. “Shake a
leg; we got lots to do before dark yet.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” said Iversen, plunging back in the sea, “frozen
feet ban yust too bad for any man. Ay tank ve better get
it done qvick before yet it gets colder!”</p>

<p>One by one, the men slipped back into the narrow lane
broken through the ice after Iversen and stolidly plodded
off in the water toward the distant boat, till only Ah Sam
and Collins were left.</p>

<p>“Shake it up there, you fellers; we ain’t got much time,”
growled Nindemann.</p>

<p>“I’m ashore now and I’m going to stay ashore!” snarled
Collins. “Do you think you’re going to get me a mile out in
the ocean again wading through that mud and ice to drag
in the captain and the dog? Well, you’re not! I might for
sick men, but not for them!”</p>

<p>“But the captain is sick! He can’t walk!” protested Nindemann.
“And besides, there’s all our food and the records to
carry in yet!”</p>

<p>“Well, he can swim then for all I care!” replied Collins
defiantly. “And as for those records, carry ’em ashore yourself.
I won’t; I didn’t ship to be treated like a common sailor,
and you can’t make me!”</p>

<p>“Suit yourself,” mumbled Nindemann uncertainly, for
Collins was after all an officer. He turned to the Chinese
cook. “Get underway there, Ah Sam.”</p>

<p>Poor Ah Sam, with his feet benumbed from constant immersion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
while bailing, staggered toward the water, then collapsed
in the mud, unable to rise. The quartermaster dragged
the inert Chinaman back on the beach and deposited him at
Collins’ feet.</p>

<p>“Get me a fire started here then, Collins, and see maybe
if you can thaw him out before I get back,” ordered Nindemann.
“I’m going for the captain,” and he plunged into the
icy seas.</p>

<p>“Where’s Ah Sam and Mr. Collins?” asked De Long
anxiously when Nindemann, much behind the others, returned
to the boat. “Anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“They’re all played out,” lied Nindemann glibly. “So I
left ’em to make a fire for us when we got back ashore.”</p>

<p>“Poor devils!” muttered the captain sympathetically. “You
should have left somebody with ’em, Nindemann.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll be all right soon,” Nindemann assured him.
“Besides, I needed here everybody,” and in that he was
right enough for it took three trips with the seamen slithering
through mud and water to get all the baggage ashore
through that mile and a half of broken ice, and it was completely
dark when Nindemann at last gathered what crew
he had left round the lightened boat and attempted to work
it ashore. But even lightened to the utmost, with nothing
but the three incapacitated men and the doctor left in it, half
a mile from the beach it stuck finally in the mud and they
could get it no further inshore. The wind freshened, bringing
a blinding snow-storm, blotting out everything. How to
get the invalids ashore was now a problem; in the slimy and
uneven footing through the shoal water they couldn’t safely
be carried. There being no other way, one after the other,
Boyd, Erichsen, and De Long were lifted over the side of
the cutter by Dr. Ambler, and stood up in the knee-deep
water on their frozen legs. Then, each held from falling by
a seaman alongside, the three sufferers partly stumbled, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
partly dragged in the falling snow across that last half mile
through the broken lane of ice to the shore, while following
them, Alexey, the Indian hunter, with Snoozer over his
shoulders, brought up the procession, finally emptying the
first cutter of its passengers.</p>

<p>It was eight at night and bitterly cold when De Long
and his companions, ashore at last on the desolate beach,
joined his forlorn seamen crowding round the fire which
Collins had started and which Noros and Görtz soon built
up with driftwood into huge proportions—the first bit of
warmth the water-soaked men had felt in five days of frigid
Arctic weather. But it was of little comfort; beneath the
snow the ground was wet, and as the fire blazed up, it further
softened the beach roundabout it, so the men trying to dry
themselves before the fire soon found instead that they were
sinking into the mushy tundra to their knees.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, men. We might as well turn in. Pitch the
tents,” ordered De Long wearily, and soon the two tents
were erected, a little shelter at least from the cutting wind.
On the soft and snow-covered ground inside them, the
wretched mariners stretched themselves out full length, for
the first time since leaving Semenovski Island, able at least
to turn in lying down.</p>

<p>More like stiffening corpses than sleepers, the exhausted
men sprawled out in the snow and soon as the driftwood fire
died away, darkness and falling snow enveloped the silent
tents, while only the whistling of the chilling wind kept
watch over De Long and his thirteen worn companions,
stretched out at last on Siberian soil, victors in a heroic
retreat over ice and ocean to which the long annals of the
sea, whether in the tropics or round about the poles, offers
no parallel.</p>

<p>Morning dawned; it snowed intermittently. Crawling from
his tent, De Long looked about. Nearby to the westward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
flowing north to discharge into the sea, was a wide river.
From the chart, this was evidently the River Osoktah, the
main northern mouth of the Lena, and close at hand should
be Sagastyr with its signal tower and a busy trading village.
But with a sinking heart, De Long, looking over the snow-covered
tundra, saw that every evidence of civilization shown
on his chart was completely missing—no signal tower, no
village, no signs of river traffic on the Lena, not even the
slightest sign of roving hunters! Petermann’s vivid descriptions
of traffic and of settlements at the Lena mouth were
only the idle dreams of an unreliable geographer, as unreal
as the Grecian myths of marvelous Atlantis to be found
just beyond the Pillars of Hercules!</p>

<p>On rescue at this point De Long had based all his plans,
figured his food supply, and savagely driven himself and
his men far beyond human endurance to get here. And now
at this long-sought goal, plainly evident to all hands, was
nothing but disillusion and despair!</p>

<p>Hobbling about him, trying to dry themselves before a
new fire, were his worn and crippled companions, all hope
gone from their haggard faces, all strength gone from their
frozen bodies, through bleared and sunken eyes, watching
him apathetically. De Long beckoned to Ambler.</p>

<p>“Do what you can for the men’s feet today, doctor, while
I sort over our stores. There’s no hope of assistance on the
coast. We may as well look this situation in the face, and
prepare ourselves to walk inland to the nearest settlement.”</p>

<p>“And where will that be?” asked the surgeon anxiously.</p>

<p>“At Ku Mark Surk, ninety-five miles to the southward,”
replied De Long.</p>

<p>“Ninety-five miles!” repeated Ambler in dismay. “Why,
some of these men can’t walk even a mile!”</p>

<p>“They’ve got to now,” answered the captain grimly. “Get
to work on our feet, doctor. Our lives depend on them now.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
Tomorrow they’ve <em>got</em> to carry us along!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir. But ninety-five miles over this tundra! In
our state now, it’s worse than that drag over the pack. We’ll
never get there!”</p>

<p>“Some of us may, and we’ll all try. It’s our last chance.
And it’s up to you, doctor. See what you can do to save our
feet!”</p>

<p>All day on one man after another, Surgeon Ambler worked
with lint, with vaseline, and with his scalpel, opening blisters,
cutting away dead skin and flesh, gently massaging
frozen feet and legs to restore circulation, and finally
bandaging up. When evening fell, De Long, Boyd, and
Ah Sam could hobble again. Even Erichsen, whom the long
motionless hours at the tiller during the storm at sea had
left with a far worse frostbite than anyone, whose two feet,
stinking with festering sores nauseated even the doctor as
he worked on those horribly swollen and blistered lumps
from which protruded black and feelingless toes, claimed to
be improved and able to walk a little.</p>

<p>While this (during a storm of snow, hail and sleet) was
going on, De Long ordered a cache made on the beach of
the navigating gear, most of the cooking utensils, the sleeping
bags, and other miscellaneous articles, so that the baggage
to be carried was reduced to the clothes the men wore,
the ship’s records, four rifles and ammunition, medicine and
surgical tools, blankets, tents, and their four days’ food
supply, consisting only of some tea and the unopened can
of pemmican which should have gone to Chipp.</p>

<p>Leaving a written record in the cache to direct anyone
who might ever come after, searching for them, on the
early afternoon of September 19th, the ragged seamen
shouldered their burdens and dragging the expedition’s
records on their little sledge, set out under a bright sun
over the snow-covered tundra for Ku Mark Surk, ninety-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
long miles to the south over the trackless delta.</p>

<p>It was a forlorn scene as De Long and his men took leave
of the Polar Sea which for two years had held them prisoner—to
the west flowed the Lena, a broad swift stream tumbling
on its swirling bosom broken floes from further up the
frozen river; to the north spread the Arctic Ocean, covered
as far as eye could reach with young ice, through which,
sticking up gaunt and bare, the only objects visible on its
desolate surface, were the mast and the low gunwales of the
abandoned cutter. To east and south lay the flat snow-covered
tundra, and over this straggled the dismal caravan of the first
cutter’s crew—Iversen and Dressler dragging the sledge,
Alexey out ahead to break a path, De Long following him
with the <em>Jeannette’s</em> ensign in its oilskin case slung across
his back, and behind him the rest of the seamen staggering
under their loads, with Lee, whose weakened hips frequently
gave way under him, constantly falling in the snow, and
Erichsen, Boyd, and Ah Sam hobbling painfully along at
the rear.</p>

<p>It was terrible going, not helped much by a fifteen minute
pause every hour for rest. The snow-covered ground was
swampy, with many ponds covered with thin ice and hidden
under the snow, and into these pitfalls the men stumbled
frequently, burying themselves to their knees in the mossy
tundra beneath, and coming up with their leaking boots or
moccasins filled, to plunge along again through the snow
and the freezing wind, oozing a slimy mixture of mud and
water from between their toes at every step.</p>

<p>Big Erichsen could barely even hobble, hardly able to
lift one numbed foot after another. At the second stop for
rest, Ambler drew Nindemann aside,</p>

<p>“Quartermaster, can’t you make a pair of crutches for
Erichsen? His arms are still strong; with crutches, he’ll make
out better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span></p>

<p>“Yah, doc, but with what should I make ’em?” asked
Nindemann. “I ain’t got tools no more.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry over that, Nindemann,” replied the doctor.
“You’ve got a knife.” He opened his medicine chest on the
sledge. “Here, take my surgical saw; I guess if it’ll saw bones,
it’ll saw wood all right,” he finished grimly.</p>

<p>Nindemann got to work on some driftwood branches,
and soon between sheath knife and bone saw, he had
fashioned a fair enough pair of crutches, on which when the
party resumed its journey, Erichsen swung along haltingly
behind the crippled Ah Sam.</p>

<p>But for the worn and burdened seamen, progress was still
snail-like. After another faltering advance, De Long halted
the party and deciding to lighten up still further, sent back
Nindemann and two other seamen with one tent, all the
log books, the spyglass, and two tins of alcohol to stow them
with the abandoned gear in the cache at the beach. This
left to be carried or dragged by the men only De Long’s
private journals as a record of the expedition, one tent, some
alcohol and medicines, the rifles, a cooking pot, and what
little food they still had, together with the silk flag which
De Long himself bore along.</p>

<p>The second day thus, the party staggered on four miles
more to the south. The going got worse, the straggling
procession lengthened out in the snow. A brief pause to
rest, and all hands once more got underway except Nindemann,
whose load chafing his shoulders, stayed behind to readjust
it while the others started off through the snow. Having
eased the fastenings of his pack as well as possible, the
wearied quartermaster struggled to his feet and was hurrying
forward to catch up with his mates when unexpectedly he
stumbled over what as he fell he thought at first was a log
half-hidden in the snowy path, but which he quickly saw
to be Erichsen, prone on his face, while nearby, tossed into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
a drift, were his crude crutches!</p>

<p>With a thumping heart, Nindemann feverishly rolled his
shipmate over on his back expecting to have to revive him,
only to find instead Erichsen’s snow-flecked blue eyes staring
bitterly at him, and Erichsen’s broken voice rising in a
curse,</p>

<p>“Go avay, damn you! Ay vant yust to die here in peace!”</p>

<p>“Get up, Hans!” pleaded Nindemann. “You’re not going
to die; nobody is. Here’s your crutches. Come along! I’ll
help you!”</p>

<p>Erichsen only shook his head, his eyes rolling in anguish.</p>

<p>“No use, Nindemann, my feet ban all gone! Even if you
can go so far as Moscow, Ay tal you, Ay cannot go one
step more! Go on! Let me die!” and with a convulsive effort
of his huge body, he twisted himself face down again and
clawing feebly with his fingers, tried to bury himself completely
in the snow.</p>

<p>Frightened, Nindemann jerked erect and shouted down
the trail,</p>

<p>“Captain! Hey, captain! Come back!” but so far off were
all hands now that no one turned. Leaving his silent shipmate
in the drift, the quartermaster, going as fast as the broken
path allowed, hurried after them, shouting occasionally, till
half a mile along he finally attracted De Long’s attention and
stopped him till he could catch up, when he told the captain
of Erichsen’s plight.</p>

<p>De Long gritted his teeth.</p>

<p>“Keep ahead, Nindemann, till you come to driftwood, then
build a fire quick and camp,” ordered De Long briefly.
“Come on, doctor; we’ll go back for Erichsen!”</p>

<p>Back rushed De Long and Ambler till buried in the snow
as Nindemann had left him, they found the prostrate Erichsen.
With some difficulty, Ambler turned him over, while
De Long pulled his crutches out from the deep snow alongside.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
The doctor took the broken seaman by both shoulders
and started to lift him.</p>

<p>“Let go me, doc,” begged Erichsen, “it ban no use any
more to help. My legs ban killing me. Ay vant now only to
die qvick! Go avay!”</p>

<p>“<em>Get up, Erichsen!</em>” ordered De Long in a voice cold as
steel. “Here’s your crutches; take ’em and get going down
that road! Do you think I’m going to leave you now? Get
underway! And when you can’t hobble, I’ll drag you! Up
now, before I jerk you up!”</p>

<p>For a moment, Erichsen, lying in the snow, stared dumbly
into the captain’s inflexible eyes, then his habit of obedience
conquered his suffering. Slowly he pushed himself into a
sitting position and without another word reached for the
crutches. With Ambler’s assistance, he rose to his feet and
then with both De Long and the doctor behind him to see
that he did not again lie down, he hobbled off down the path,
each step undoubtedly an agony to him as his bleeding and
tortured feet came down in the snow. And so, slowly and
painfully they covered the last mile into the camp, where a
roaring driftwood fire and a scanty supper of cold pemmican
and tea awaited them.</p>

<p>Before the fire, all hands steamed in front while they froze
behind, and then stretched out on driftwood logs for a bed,
hauled their sole remaining tent flat over the fourteen of
them and turned in. But between sharp winds, bitter cold,
and falling snow, it was a fearful night for the fourteen
sufferers, shaking and shivering beneath the thin canvas, and
no one slept.</p>

<p>Through snow and fog again the party struggled southward
along the river bank next day, with Boyd and Ah Sam
both improved, and even Erichsen, the captain’s stern voice
still ringing in his ears, doing a little better on his crutches.
But with only two days’ slim rations of pemmican left, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
with each day’s progress hardly a scant five miles over the
snowy tundra, the chances of making the remaining eighty
miles to Ku Mark Surk began to fade.</p>

<p>In the middle of the third afternoon, the party came to two
abandoned wood huts by the river side, the first evidence of
habitation they had met in the Lena Delta, and gladly all
hands entered. Inside the huts, reasonably sheltered for the
first time in weeks from cold, from wind, and from snow, and
with plenty of driftwood about so they could warm themselves
at last, the men stripped off their soaked and ragged
furs and stood about naked while their clothes dried before
the hurriedly built fires.</p>

<p>Dressed again, and with a tiny portion of pemmican and
some hot tea for supper, the exhausted travelers threw themselves
on the dirt floor, at last to catch some sleep inside a
human habitation, primitive even though it was. No one any
longer had a sleeping bag; only the patched and ragged
remnants of the fur and cloth garments and the long since
worn-out boots in which three months before they had
started the terrible journey over the ice from the sunken
<em>Jeannette</em> remained to them. But at least there was a tight roof
and solid walls about them and it was enough. In a few minutes,
at four o’clock in the afternoon, thankful beyond description
for so much shelter, all hands were sound asleep.</p>

<p>But there was one exception. Shelter or no shelter, Erichsen,
suffering the agonies of the damned from his mortifying
feet, only tossed and moaned, waking the doctor. Rousing
Nindemann to help him, the surgeon seated the suffering
seaman on a log before the fire, got his instruments and medicines,
and then, while Nindemann held the patient erect on
the log, gently proceeded to unbandage his left foot, the
worst one.</p>

<p>As the last turn of the bandage came off, Nindemann
anxiously watching, saw to his horror, all the flesh, dead and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
putrid, drop away from the ball of the foot, exposing tendons
and bones. Startled, he closed his eyes, repressed a groan.
But Ambler said nothing; only the slight compression of his
lips indicated his despair. There was nothing medical skill
could do. Quietly smearing a fresh bandage with vaseline, he
carefully bound up the foot again and put back Erichsen’s
stocking and his boot.</p>

<p>“All done, Erichsen,” he said reassuringly; “you can turn
in now,” and gathering up his equipment, Ambler, his heart
torn by poor Erichsen’s condition, hurriedly stretched himself
out in the hut as far away as he could get lest his patient
should start to question him.</p>

<p>But Erichsen was not wholly ignorant of what had happened.
Turning to Nindemann on the log beside him, he
asked,</p>

<p>“Do you know much about frostbites?”</p>

<p>“Yah, Hans,” replied Nindemann, “at the first coming on,
the flesh turns blue and then it gets black.”</p>

<p>The big Dane nodded, continued sadly,</p>

<p>“Ven doc took off the bandage, Ay saw somet’ing drop
from unter my foot. You saw it too, Nindemann. Yah?”</p>

<p>Nindemann, with one arm about his suffering shipmate to
keep him erect, looked him squarely in the eye, and putting
all the conviction into his voice that he could muster, he lied
heroically,</p>

<p>“No, Hans, there was nothing. You must be dreaming
things.”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to fool me, qvartermaster; Ay tal you Ay saw
it und so did you.” Mournfully he gazed at his shabby boot,
then sadly shook his head. “Ay hope you get home yet,
Nindemann, but vit me, it ban all done. Stretch me out now;
you must sleep.”</p>

<p>But it being still early in the evening, after a brief nap,
De Long sent Alexey and Nindemann out with rifles to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
hunt, the while the others rested and he took stock of the
situation.</p>

<p>Long and earnestly, as the two hunters trudged outside
through the snow looking for game, the captain pondered.
His recent chart, based on Petermann’s reports and descriptions
of the villages on the delta itself, he now knew was
worthless; only in the old Russian chart showing Ku Mark
Surk at the head of the delta and Bulun beyond could he put
any faith. But with the nearest of these over eighty miles distant,
it was hopeless to expect that his crawling party, making
at best five miles a day, could ever get through on the
two days’ pemmican still left. And without food to sustain
them on the way, the outside temperature, hovering around
zero, would of itself in a few more nights in the open like
the preceding one, quickly make an end of them. There
seemed nothing for it except to stay in the huts where at
least they had shelter and warmth and stretch to the utmost
their few pounds of pemmican, eked out by poor Snoozer as
a last resort, the while he sent two men ahead on a forced
march to Ku Mark Surk in the thin hope that he might keep
his starving men alive till they returned with aid, in two
weeks at the soonest if they found the traveling good, longer
if they did not.</p>

<p>What alternatives were there? He considered them. Erichsen,
Lee, Boyd, and Ah Sam were his drags on progress, especially
the two former. If he left these two, the others might
easily double their speed of travel and reach Ku Mark Surk
and safety in possibly a week. But it would take at least a
second week to get help back to his abandoned men. How
could two helpless cripples without food, hardly able to
crawl outside to gather wood to warm themselves, stay alive
for two long weeks, perhaps more? They would soon, hopeless
in the feeling that they were deserted, both lie down
and die. As it was, only his constant driving, his apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
soulless harshness, and the lash of his stinging commands, kept
them hobbling weakly along.</p>

<p>Could he abandon them? Dispassionately he tried to consider
it. On one hand, a far better chance for life to twelve
men, certain death for two. On the other hand, the strong
probability that all would perish in that hut before relief
arrived. Going on, leaving his cripples behind, looked logical.
But De Long shook his head. While he lived, he could
abandon nobody to the loneliness of that Arctic waste, least
of all the heroic Erichsen, who unrelieved through that terrible
night in the boat, had clung to the tiller, safely steering
them all through the gale, and now in the agony of his decaying
feet, was uncomplainingly paying the penalty of his
steadfastness. With a sigh, the captain decided to stay on in
the hut, while he sent ahead for help. Who should go? Running
over in his mind the physical condition of his men, he
decided on Surgeon Ambler and Nindemann, the two he felt
who were most likely to get through.</p>

<p>At six o’clock, Nindemann returned, empty-handed except
for a dead gull he had found. Eagerly the hungry seamen,
roused by Nindemann’s entrance, crowded round while
Ah Sam plucked the gull, only to discover that the carcass
had long since rotted. Sadly it was thrown away, and the
disappointed sailors once more turned in. Alexey still was
missing, but no fears were felt for him, and quickly, without
exception now, the exhausted company sank into deep
slumber.</p>

<p>About nine o’clock came a knock on the door of the hut
and Alexey’s voice rang out,</p>

<p>“All sleep here?”</p>

<p>Immediately, sleeping heads lifted here and there over the
floor as the door flew back and Alexey cried proudly,</p>

<p>“Captain! I shoot two reindeer!” and in staggered the snow-covered
hunter bearing on his back the hind quarter of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
doe.</p>

<p>“Well done, Alexey!” shouted the captain, leaping to his
feet and kissing the startled Indian while all about men
sprang up, almost smothering the beaming Alexey in handclasps
and in clumsy hugs. Immediately sleep was forgotten,
the fires poked up, and that haunch of venison, cut in chunks,
was roasting on a dozen sticks. Each man got a pound and a
half; most of them, long before their meat was hardly more
than seared before the fire, were gorging themselves on the
raw flesh! With startling rapidity, it disappeared and hungrily
his men looked toward the bloody remnant of that
haunch, but De Long, stowing it behind him in the hut, shook
his head and ended the feast, leaving the party no option but
to return to sleep, while only Snoozer, still gnawing wolfishly
at the shank bone, remained awake.</p>

<p>That changed De Long’s plans. Issuing only a very scanty
ration of pemmican for breakfast, he sent Alexey and six
men out in the morning to get the deer, while he concluded
to spend that day and the next in the hut, recuperating the
sick, and then with his two days’ supply of pemmican still
intact and the remainder of the two does for food on the
journey, push on southward with all hands.</p>

<p>And so they did. Warmed by soup made of the reindeer
bones, fortified by deer meat, and rested by two days’ inaction
in the hut, the party set out hopefully on September 24th
with twenty pounds of pemmican and fifty-four pounds of
venison still left for food for fourteen men and their dog,
leaving a note and the captain’s Winchester rifle (for which
there was no longer any ammunition) as a record behind
them.</p>

<p>They tramped along the east bank of the river for three
miles, resting hourly and making poor progress. Looking
hopelessly at the broad stream still flowing unfrozen past
him, De Long sighed for his abandoned cutter, in which here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
with oars and sail, they might make fine progress even against
the current. But the cutter was gone and wishes would do no
good. However, they might perhaps make a raft and sail or
pole that upstream, at least relieving their feet. So stopping
the party, De Long turned all hands to gathering logs out
of which, using the sledge lashing for a fastening, a crude
raft was finally fashioned at the cost of eight hours’ strenuous
toil, on which at five p.m. they attempted to embark. But
the river had ebbed meanwhile, and in spite of an hour’s
battle, it was impossible to get the grounded side of the raft
afloat. In deep disgust, amid the suppressed curses of all
hands at the result (and especially of Nindemann who had
done most of the work), the raft was abandoned, the loads
picked up again, and the men, doubly weary now, staggered
away southward, again to camp for the night on the open
tundra, freezing on a few logs spread in the snow for a bed,
to rise next morning after no sleep at all, stiffer and sorer
even than the night before.</p>

<p>The next day’s traveling was difficult beyond words, over
snow and thin ice through which torn boots broke, to come
up covered with a slushy mixture which immediately froze
solid, soon making each man’s feet as large and as heavy as
sandbags, a gruelling task to lift them, an endless labor to
keep them reasonably cleared.</p>

<p>By some miscalculation either in issue or in original weighing,
but eight pounds of deer meat was found remaining, all
of which went for dinner. An afternoon of heartbreaking
travel over an ice-coated bluff from which the piercing wind
had cleared all snow, leaving it slippery as glass, brought
them at night to a dilapidated hut, filthy in its interior, but
nevertheless the freezing seamen, taking it for a godsend,
stretched themselves promptly in the dirt inside, unutterably
grateful for the shelter. A scant portion of pemmican passed
for supper. With only three similar rations apiece left as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
total food supply, the toil-worn men turned in, grumbling
audibly for the immediate issue of the remnant of the pemmican
and De Long began to fear open rebellion.</p>

<p>Day broke inauspiciously. Before them, blocking the way,
was a swift side stream, too deep to ford, with ice too thin
to walk upon. De Long, after examining all possibilities of
crossing, ordered Nindemann to build a raft to ferry over on,
and Nindemann, tired, hungry and bitter over the fiasco attending
the raft of a few days before, went grumblingly at it.
While he and his shipmates struggled with the logs and the
single line they had for a lashing, De Long silently ignoring
the none too well hidden signs of growing disaffection went
back to the hut. Outside the door, Ambler met him, pulled
him aside,</p>

<p>“Erichsen’s condition is getting desperate, captain. Both
feet are worse; another couple of days and nothing in God’s
world can keep him on them.”</p>

<p>“All right, doctor. We’ll do the best we can,” said De
Long resolutely. “Keep him going to the last minute, then
we’ll drag him. Meanwhile, I’d better keep an eye on the
work on that raft.”</p>

<p>By ten a.m. the raft was done, a crazy affair and not very
large due to the lack of sufficient lashings. With Collins,
Alexey and Lee as passengers, and Nindemann and Kaack
as ferrymen, it started over, amid voluble cursing promptly
submerging all hands to their knees. But nevertheless it got
successfully over to shoal water on the other side, where
Nindemann started to look for a good landing spot.</p>

<p>“Don’t waste time!” shouted De Long. “Let those men
wade ashore and hurry back with that raft!”</p>

<p>After considerable growling, audible even to De Long on
the other shore, the passengers waded off, and the two ferrymen
paddled back. On his return, Nindemann promptly
started grumbling again about the raft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Nindemann?” asked De Long.</p>

<p>“The lashings are loose and there ain’t enough logs to
float it,” said Nindemann sullenly.</p>

<p>“Well, you made the raft. Haul the lashing tighter then if
it doesn’t suit you,” suggested the captain.</p>

<p>“But I hauled it already as tight as I could,” protested the
irritated quartermaster.</p>

<p>“That’ll do!” Curtly De Long cut him short. “Get more
logs if you want them; tighten the lashing if you wish, but
quit standing there! I’ve had enough of your grumbling!
Shake it up, now! We’ve got to get on!”</p>

<p>Glowering at the reproof, Nindemann, his nerves finally
at the breaking point, glared a moment at the skipper, then
turned and moved down the bank. A few steps off, facing
the next gang of men waiting to cross on the raft, the stocky
quartermaster clenched his fists, swung them wildly in the
captain’s direction and shouted,</p>

<p>“I would sooner be along with the devil than be along
with you! I wish I was in hell, or somewhere else than here,
by Jesus Christ!”</p>

<p>Quietly De Long looked from the little knot of men on
the raft to Nindemann’s circling fists, then in an icy voice,
he ordered,</p>

<p>“Nindemann! Come back here!”</p>

<p>Slowly the infuriated quartermaster approached his captain,
to find a pair of cold blue eyes drilling into him.</p>

<p>“So you’d sooner be shipmates with the devil than with me,
eh? You’ll find yourself in hell quick enough if you don’t
do what I say! What’s the matter now?”</p>

<p>Nindemann quailed, his mutinous passion suddenly chilling
before that frigid gaze.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, sir,” he mumbled weakly.</p>

<p>“Another word from you and I’ll have you courtmartialed!”
said De Long coldly. “Now get up into that hut and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
consider yourself under arrest until I send for you!”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” answered Nindemann, and meekly he
scrambled up the bluff to the hut, while the captain looked
down at the men milling round on the raft.</p>

<p>“Görtz! Lend Kaack a hand with those paddles! Shove off
now!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” Immediately the raft started its second
trip.</p>

<p>It was slow work. Not till three in the afternoon was the
raft ready for the last load. Then sending Erichsen down
first, De Long peered into the hut at Nindemann crouching
before the fire.</p>

<p>“Pick up your traps, quartermaster, and get to work
again!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” said Nindemann obediently, and hastily
gathering up his load, he ran down to the raft where for the
last trip he paddled over and then, dismantling the logs to
recover the priceless lashings, he looked expectantly up to
the captain for orders.</p>

<p>“Build a fire,” said the skipper briefly. “We’ll have dinner
here and dry ourselves before moving on.”</p>

<p>They made four miles by dark, camped in the snow, froze
as usual instead of sleeping, ate a skimpy breakfast, and with
but a single meal left, the party was about to break camp,
when far away Nindemann spotted some reindeer approaching
the river. Keeping everybody down, the captain sent
Alexey and Nindemann out with rifles.</p>

<p>Circling three miles to get to leeward of the small herd of
reindeer, the two hunters crawled cautiously along on their
stomachs another quarter mile, pausing, with their very lives
depending on their care, each time a deer looked in their
direction, then snaking along again through the snow. At
last, within a hundred yards, they stopped, picked out the
two largest bucks they could see, and at a word from Alexey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
fired simultaneously.</p>

<p>Down went the buck at which Alexey’s Remington was
aiming, but Nindemann’s Winchester misfired and before
Alexey could get in another shot, the startled herd was off.
Firing nevertheless, Alexey swung to the moving targets,
but failed to hit again. Leaping up, the two men ran in to secure
their prize and saw joyfully that Alexey had knocked
over a fine buck, as large as both the does which he had previously
shot. It took five men to drag him in to camp, and
there, all thought of movement suspended, the ravenous men
turned to on frying deer meat, gulping down three pounds
apiece before the captain finally called a halt on eating, and
ordering his crew to shoulder the remainder of the buck,
provisions for three days more, they got underway again
in the teeth of a driving snow-storm.</p>

<p>By the next afternoon, September 28th, having spent the
previous night again in the snow, De Long came to an empty
hut on a promontory and looking off ahead, found himself
trapped! On his right, running north was the Lena; before
him, running east, was another broad river branching away
from it and neither one could he ford, nor after a diligent
search, find any materials about of which to make a raft.
Huddled in the dirty hut, his utterly tired men sprawled out
before the fire, while Alexey scouted the river to the eastward
for a ford, but found none.</p>

<p>For three days, the ill-fated refugees were forced to remain
in that hut, unable to move in any direction except
back northward, while a gale outside brought heavy snow;
and bitterly cursing their enforced inaction while consuming
their precious provisions, they waited, hopeless of movement
till in the increasing cold, the river should freeze hard enough
for them to cross. And meanwhile, fearing Erichsen would
get lockjaw if he waited further, Dr. Ambler was forced to
amputate first all his toes and then saw away a good part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
the remainder of the unfortunate Dane’s feet, leaving him
with useless stumps on which it was hopeless to expect, even
with crutches, that Hans Erichsen would ever walk again.</p>

<p>The captain became desperate. He cut the issue of deer
meat down to the limit, sent Alexey out in the blinding snow
to hunt in one direction, Nindemann in another, and Görtz
and Kaack with fish lines to see whether the rivers which
were choking off their progress, might at least yield up a
few fish to eke out their provisions. But except for one gull
which Alexey knocked off a pole with a rifle ball, not a solitary
bit of food did anyone get.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the problem of how to move Erichsen became
acute. Finding a solitary driftwood plank, six inches thick
and about four feet long, Nindemann was turned to with a
hatchet and the doctor’s saw (which but a few hours before
had been used on Erichsen’s feet) to make a sledge on which
to haul him, and by the night of September 30th, it was done.</p>

<p>October 1st came and the Arctic winter descended on
them in earnest. After a bitterly cold night, they issued from
the hut to find the Lena apparently frozen from bank to
bank. Cautiously, with the thin ice cracking ominously beneath
them at each step, Alexey and Nindemann scouted a
path across, then one by one, with the men widely separated,
to distribute the weight, the others crawled over, last of
all Erichsen on his sledge drawn by two men some distance
apart hauling on a long line.</p>

<p>With all hands finally on the west bank without mishap,
the party turned south and for three days struggled on
through increasingly bitter cold, never finding any shelter,
sometimes traveling on through the night because that was
less of a torture than freezing while stretched out in the
snowdrifts. The delta became a maze of intersecting streams
among which De Long was wholly unable to locate his position
on his useless charts. And a new horror was added to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
their others—Erichsen became delirious and each time the
shivering men halted, he raved incessantly in Danish and English,
making sleep impossible even had the frigid nights otherwise
permitted it. And then the food (except for tea) gave
out completely, first the remaining scraps of reindeer going;
finally the last hoarded bits of the pemmican (which for
nearly four months they had dragged with them from the
<em>Jeannette</em>) went for dinner on October 3rd.</p>

<p>Without food the party staggered on from their dinner
camp, De Long praying earnestly that some game might by
a miracle again cross their path. But they saw none, and
weak with hunger dragged their ice-clogged feet along, skirting
the thin ice on the river edge where the going was easier
than on the mossy snow-covered tundra. Suddenly De Long
broke through and went into the river up to his shoulders;
while he was being hauled out, Görtz plunged through to
his neck and Collins was soused to his waist. A moment after
they had been dragged back to the surface soaked to their
skins, each was a glistening sheet of ice, with no help for it
but to keep hobbling onward till evening, when still in the
open, they camped by the river bank and, in the midst of a
whistling gale of wind and snow they huddled round a driftwood
fire where the ice-coated sufferers endeavored vainly
to thaw themselves out.</p>

<p>There was nothing left for food for the wan and hungry
crew—except Snoozer. De Long, hoping to take at least this
favorite dog back home with him, had clung tenaciously to
Snoozer through thick and thin, kept him in the boat when
the other dogs ran off at Bennett Island, saved him when the
other seamen would have left him to starve or drown in the
abandoned cutter off the Siberian coast, fed him from his
vanishing store of pemmican when he had little enough to
eat himself. But now with his men starving about him, desperately
needing food if they were to hold a little life in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
their chilling bodies, sentiment and affection had to give way.
Sadly he called over Boyd and Iversen, told them to take
Snoozer where no one could see them, kill him, and dress the
carcass.</p>

<p>So for supper each had a little dog meat, eaten with revulsion
by everyone, but eaten. And then followed a night
horrible beyond description. Erichsen’s ravings mingled with
the whistling of the wind; in the sub-zero blackness, the
stupefied men, unsheltered from the driving snow, crouched
about a fire from which they could get no warmth; in his
wet and freezing garments, De Long huddled alongside
Alexey to keep from freezing to death; while all about,
shivering limbs and chattering teeth beat a gruesome accompaniment
to Erichsen’s groans as lashed to his sledge, as close
to the fire as they dared put him, he alternately shrieked and
moaned in delirium till finally he lapsed into a coma.</p>

<p>Morning came at last, to bring the unpleasant discovery
that Erichsen had somehow worked off his mittens during
the night and both his hands were completely frozen, through
and through. The doctor set Boyd and Iversen to work chafing
his fingers and palms, endeavoring to restore the circulation,
but it proved hopeless. Erichsen was now totally unconscious.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Alexey had spied a hut a few miles off, and
after a hastily swallowed cup of tea which constituted breakfast,
the men hurriedly shouldered their burdens and dragging
their unfortunate shipmate, moved off toward it, fumbling
along through the driving snow and the intense cold for
two hours, when, fervently thanking God for the shelter,
they reached the hut and building a fire inside, proceeded to
get warm for the first time in four days.</p>

<p>Here after a brief prayer for the unconscious Dane, read
in a broken voice by the captain, the entire party (except
Alexey) sank to the floor to rest at last. Alexey refused to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
rest. He had shipped for the cruise, not as a seaman but as a
hunter, and now with his captain and his mates urgently needing
food, regardless of himself, he went out to seek it. But
there was not the slightest sign of game about, and frozen
worse than ever from having broken through the river ice
on his hunt, the faithful Indian was at last compelled to return
empty-handed.</p>

<p>Supper, half a pound of dog meat apiece, and the last of the
tea, was the only meal for the day, but grateful to be out of
the blizzard raging roundabout, no one complained.</p>

<p>October 5th came and went, commencing in a breakfast
consisting only of hot water colored by re-used tea leaves
and ending with a supper composed of the last of the dog
meat and more hot water barely tinted with third-time used
tea leaves. Hour by hour the men sat, crowded in the little
hut gazing at Erichsen, occasionally conscious now, while his
strength slowly ebbed away and his tongue babbled feebly
about his far-off Denmark. Night fell, the storm howled on,
the dying seaman relapsed again into a coma, and his overwrought
shipmates sagged down on the dirt floor to rest.</p>

<p>October 6th came and in the early morning light, Erichsen
died. Sadly in the driving snow, the grief-stricken sailors
gathered round a hole cut through the river ice while broken-hearted,
De Long sobbed out the funeral service over the
body of as brave and staunch a seaman as ever sacrificed
his life to save his shipmates. And there in the Arctic wastes,
where he so long had suffered, with three volleys from all the
rifles in the party ringing out over the ice as a final salute,
mournfully his gaunt and frozen comrades consigned Hans
Erichsen, their strongest and their best man, to the Lena’s
waters.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">With some old tea leaves and two quarts of grain alcohol as
their entire food supply, the thirteen survivors gloomily resumed
their southward trek on October 7th. The snow was
deep and still falling; the weakened men ploughed through
it to their waists. A little alcohol mixed in water constituted
dinner; a little more of the same was served out for supper
and night found them camping in the snow.</p>

<p>October 8th, underway again over thin ice, De Long
sought a trail over the wandering streams and through the
multitude of islands where the spreading Lena flattened out
over the low delta lands and its surface waters, churning in
swirling eddies, were not yet completely frozen over. More
and more frequently the faltering men paused to rest; De
Long particularly, whose freezing immersion of a few days
before had sadly damaged his feet, was in worse condition
than anyone save Lee, whose weakening hips continually
gave way, plunging him drunkenly into the drifts every
other step. Badly strung out, the line of starving seamen
staggered along with their captain in the rear, constantly refusing
the offers of his men to relieve him of the load he carried
and thus ease the way for him. When finally they
halted for the night, shelterless on the bleak and open tundra,
his hungry men had once again to be content with nothing
more substantial to fill the aching voids in their stomachs
than hot water and half an ounce of alcohol. De Long, watching
them drop feebly in their tracks in the snow with Ku
Mark Surk still (as he thought) over twelve miles away, concluded
sadly that they could never all cover that last stretch
alive. Without the slightest chance now of getting food in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
the deserted delta, they would soon in their weakened condition
use up the last dregs of their fading vitality and quickly
freeze to death in their tracks. His only hope lay in sending
a few stronger men ahead for help, while in some shelter, if
they could find it now, the rest of them, fighting off starvation,
conserved their little remaining strength and awaited
rescue. With that resolve, he beckoned Nindemann to his side
in the snow.</p>

<p>“Nindemann,” said the captain earnestly, “I’m sending you
ahead tomorrow to get through to Ku Mark Surk for aid.
It should be only twelve miles south now. You ought to do it
in three days, maybe four at the most, and get back in four
more. Meanwhile, we’ll follow in your trail. I’ll give you one
of our two rifles, your share of the alcohol for food, and
you can take any man in the party with you except Alexey
to help you out. Alexey we must keep as a hunter. Who
do you want?”</p>

<p>The quartermaster thought a moment, then answered,</p>

<p>“I’ll take Noros, captain.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t Iversen better?” asked De Long anxiously. “I think
he’s stronger.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Nindemann, “he’s been complaining of his
feet three days now.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, captain,” broke in Dr. Ambler who was
alongside the skipper. “Noros is best.”</p>

<p>“All right; Noros then. Be ready, both of you in the
morning.” Stiffly De Long stretched himself out before the
tiny camp fire crackling feebly in the snow.</p>

<p>Morning found thirteen somber seamen looking anxiously
off over the frozen tangle of rivers and of islands to the
south. Somewhere there beyond that terrible delta land lay
Ku Mark Surk and life, but all about them was only the vast
snow-crusted tundra, an Arctic waste of wintry desolation
and the promise of slow death. Solemnly De Long shook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
Nindemann’s hand.</p>

<p>“You’ll do all a man can do to get us help, I know, Nindemann,”
he said. “God keep you safe and bring you soon
again to us.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got much hope of finding help, captain,” responded
the quartermaster gloomily. “It’s farther maybe to Ku Mark
Surk than you think.”</p>

<p>“Well, do the best you can. If you find assistance, come
back to us as quickly as possible. God knows we need it
here! If you don’t—” The captain’s voice broke at that implication,
he paused a moment, then concluded huskily, “Why
then you’re still as well off as we; you see the condition we
are in.” He turned to Nindemann’s companion, standing in
the snow beside him,</p>

<p>“Noros, are you ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes, captain.”</p>

<p>De Long looked them over. They carried nothing but one
rifle, forty cartridges, and a small rubber bag with three
ounces of alcohol, their share of the party’s sole remaining
substitute for food. Their clothes were ragged, their sealskin
trousers bare of fur, their boots full of holes. The captain’s
eyes lingered on the toes protruding from the remnants of
their footgear.</p>

<p>“Don’t wade in the river, men. Keep on the banks,” he
finished gently.</p>

<p>There was a bustling in the little knot of men surrounding
them, and Collins suddenly pushed through to confront De
Long.</p>

<p>“I’m the <em>New York Herald</em> correspondent with this expedition,”
he said bruskly. “As James Gordon Bennett’s representative,
I demand the right to go with these men!”</p>

<p>De Long, surprised at the interruption, flushed slightly,
then answered evenly,</p>

<p>“Mr. Collins, we’ll settle that question with Mr. Bennett<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
in New York. At present, getting you or anybody through
as a newspaper correspondent interests me very little. And
in any other capacity, just now you’re only a hindrance to
this expedition; you’re much too weak to keep up with
Nindemann. You wouldn’t last five miles!” and turning his
back on Collins, he gripped Noros’ hand, shook it warmly,
and repeated,</p>

<p>“Remember, Noros. Keep out of the water! That’s all.
Shove off now, men!”</p>

<p>Bending forward against the wind, Noros and Nindemann
staggered away toward the south, the last forlorn hope of the
eleven emaciated castaways standing in the frozen drifts
behind them, cheering them as they vanished in the blinding
snow.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">“And that was on October 9th, Mr. Melville,” sobbed Nindemann.
“But Ku Mark Surk wasn’t twelve miles away like
the captain thought; it was over seventy miles! His chart was
bad, and besides before, every day he hadn’t traveled so far
as he guessed maybe. For ten whole days after that, Noros
and me went south over terrible country, and we found
to eat only one ptarmigan I shot with the rifle, and we ate
up first our boot soles and then most of our sealskin pants
and we froze and kept on going till even the sealskin pants
was all gone and we had traveled over forty miles and still
we had not come to Ku Mark Surk. And all the while we
dragged ourselves along because we knew our shipmates
could get no food in that country we had gone over and they
were starving and the captain trusted Noros and me to get
help for them.</p>

<p>“But after ten days we were freezing in only our underwear
for clothes and we were so weak without food that we
could not go on and when we saw at last an empty hut, we
crawled inside there to die but we found in it a little rotten
dried fish that looked like sawdust and tasted like it too and
we ate that, thinking maybe then we could keep on again
but the mouldy fish made us so sick with dysentery we could
not even any more crawl, and we lay there three days
expecting only to die soon, when at last some natives looked
in that hut and found us! We would be dead there in that
hut long ago if not for them!” Nindemann choked back a
bitter sob and gripped my hand feebly. “We couldn’t make
them natives understand they had to go back north for the
captain and they brought us first to Ku Mark Surk and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
here to Bulun. And now it is November 2nd, eleven more
days even since they found us, and there is no hope for anybody
any more! The captain and our shipmates must now all
be dead in that snow!” And racked with sobs at the idea that
somehow he had failed in the captain’s trust, Nindemann
wept hysterically.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they found shelter in a hut,” I suggested, trying
to calm him. “I’ll start back right now to look anyway.”</p>

<p>“No use,” repeated the quartermaster hopelessly. “For a
long ways from where we left them, there ain’t no huts, only
a hundred rivers going every way and for a man twice to find
the same spot there is impossible. You ain’t so strong no more.
You’ll only die yourself!”</p>

<p>I laid the weeping seaman back on his couch. Probably he
was right. But so long as the faintest shred of hope existed
for Captain De Long and his comrades, I must look for them.</p>

<p>I got the best directions I could from Noros and from
Nindemann as to the route south they had traveled, where
they had stopped each night, the rivers they had crossed.
Taking either man with me as a guide was impossible; they
could not travel. So leaving instructions for my whaleboat
party that, except for Bartlett (who was to stay in Bulun
to search for me if in a month I did not return), all the
others on arrival there were to proceed under Lieutenant
Danenhower’s charge south to Yakutsk, I got a dog sled and
immediately started north. At Ku Mark Surk I met the Russian
Commandant next day; he helped me with another dog
team and a ten day supply of fish. With that I proceeded
northward along Nindemann’s trail from Ku Mark Surk,
having two native drivers and twenty-two dogs.</p>

<p>Through fierce November storms we pushed on down the
delta, sometimes finding Nindemann’s trail, often losing it.
The going was slow, the cold was intense, we were frequently
stopped by gales which completely blinded us and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
against which the dogs refused to travel, instead lying down
in the snow and howling dolefully. The river began to divide
as it spread out over the flat and treeless delta. One after
another I searched along innumerable streams for Nindemann’s
trail but in the deepening snows found no sign as we
went north. Wrapped in thick furs, I nevertheless nearly
froze to death on my sledge. It was inconceivable that De
Long and his companions, long without food, clothed only in
scanty rags, could live through such weather. But still I
searched, hopeful now at least of recovering their bodies.</p>

<p>Our food gave out, the Yakut drivers wanted to return to
Ku Mark Surk. I enquired if there were any village on the
delta itself from which we might continue our search. They
said there was one. On the far northwestern corner of the
delta on the Arctic shore, some thirty miles due west of
where from Nindemann’s account De Long had landed on
the coast, was a small village called Tomat. I looked at my
chart, a copy I had long ago made at Semenovski Island of
De Long’s. There was no village marked there on that chart,
but knowing now the chart to be wholly unreliable, I accepted
my drivers’ statements as being true and ordered them
to head for Tomat to replenish our food supply, intending
then to pick up De Long’s trail at the abandoned boat, and
follow him southward from there till I came upon his party,
whether alive or dead. But my drivers protested; we must
turn about and return to Ku Mark Surk; without food, we
would all perish on the desolate road to Tomat. Fiercely I
turned on them in their native tongue.</p>

<p>“Head north!” I ordered savagely. “And when we have to,
we’ll eat the dogs! And when they’re gone, by God, I’ll eat
you if necessary to get north to Tomat! Keep on north!”</p>

<p>Cowed by my threats, and thoroughly believing that this
wild stranger from the sea might well turn cannibal, the dog
drivers headed northwest toward Tomat, the solitary village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
on that northern Arctic coast. For three days our laboring
dogs dragged us through the drifts along the road to Tomat,
fortunately for us following a chain of deserted huts in each
of which we found refuse scraps of fish heads, entrails of
reindeer, and such similar offal, the which we (both men
and dogs) ate greedily to save us from starvation, and on
the fourth day, so frozen that I had to be carried from my
sledge into a hut, we arrived at Tomat.</p>

<p>Staying there only a day to thaw out, to change my dogs
for fresh ones, and to replenish my food supply (in that poor
village, itself facing the winter with scanty food, getting each
solitary fish was harder indeed than extracting from the villagers
their teeth), I started east along the Arctic coast, with
my feet so badly frozen I could not walk.</p>

<p>By evening, marked by a pole, I found the cache De Long
had left on the beach but so thick was the falling snow I
could not see the first cutter offshore. Salvaging the log
books and the <em>Jeannette’s</em> navigating outfit, I loaded them on
my sledges and turned south till I came on the first hut where
De Long had stopped. For a week after, amid frigid Arctic
gales with the temperature far below zero, I searched along
the solidly frozen Lena, visiting every hut, finishing finally
in that hut on the promontory where for three days De
Long had waited for the rivers to freeze so he might cross,
and where Dr. Ambler had sliced off Erichsen’s toes. There
beyond the frozen river, on the wind-swept further shore, for
a short distance I could follow where his toiling shipmates
had dragged Erichsen along on his sledge, for the deep
grooves left in the soft slush a month and a half before now
stood clearly out in solid ice.</p>

<p>But there finally I lost the trail. The deep drifts of many
snows buried all tracks. Facing a myriad of wandering
streams, any one of which De Long might have followed
south, I searched in vain for further tracks, for the hut in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
which Erichsen had finally died, for the epitaph board which
Nindemann told me he had left there to mark it, but not
another trace of De Long or of his party could I find in the
ever-thickening snow as storm succeeded storm and buried
the Lena Delta in drifts so deep that my floundering dogs
could scarcely drag me through them.</p>

<p>It was now late November, six wintry weeks since without
food and without shelter, De Long had parted somewhere
thereabouts in that ghastly wilderness from his two messengers.
Only one of two things now was possible—either De
Long and his party had somehow been found by natives who
were sheltering him, quite as safe as I myself; or he had long
since perished and was somewhere buried beneath the snowdrifts
on the open tundra, where in the dead of winter it was
hopeless to search for him. Weak and frozen myself from
my desperate search, coming on top of my long exposure in
the open whaleboat, it was now imperative that I get out of
the delta before my frozen corpse found an unmarked grave
beneath the snows alongside my missing shipmates. So sadly
I ordered my worn dogs south. It took us a week to fight
our way back to Ku Mark Surk at the delta head, and two
days more to cover the final fearful miles along the Lena
through the mountain gorges up to Bulun, where at last at
the end of November I arrived, sick at heart at my failure
to find my comrades, terribly sick physically from rotten
food, from hunger, and with numbed limbs from which the
Arctic cold had drained away every vestige of life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">All winter long, while endeavoring to recuperate my frozen
arms and legs, I gathered supplies and sledges from Bulun,
from far-off Yakutsk, from all the villages between, for an
intensive search of the delta in early March before the annual
springtime freshets, feeding the Lena with the melting
snows of southern Siberia, should come pouring out on the
flat delta, burying it in a flood of raging waters and sweeping
my shipmates out into the Arctic Sea.</p>

<p>I kept only Nindemann, now recovered, and Bartlett with
me to help me in my search. All the remaining survivors, a
pitiful party, under Lieutenant Danenhower’s charge, went
south over the fifteen hundred mile trail to Irkutsk. Poor
Aneguin, weakened by exposure, died before he got out of
Siberia; Jack Cole, violently insane, reached America only
to die soon after in a government asylum; and Danenhower
himself, broken in health, after a few brief years spent undergoing
a long series of operations, soon followed him to
the grave. The rest except for Leach, whose toes had to be
amputated, reached America safe and sound. Meanwhile by
courier from Bulun to Irkutsk, the head of the telegraph lines
in Siberia, the news of the disaster to the <em>Jeannette</em> finally
went out on December 21.</p>

<p>For two and a half years not a word of us had ever reached
civilization. As the months since our departure lengthened
into years and no news came, anxiety in America and in
Europe over our fate deepened into keen alarm. Swallowed
by the trackless Arctic, fear for us grew, and in the summer
of 1881, two relief expeditions fitted out by the American
government went north to search for us. But where should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
they look? Which way did the polar currents go from Behring
Strait where we had entered? No one knew save we on
the <em>Jeannette</em> and our knowledge was useless to a world
facing a search of the unknown north.</p>

<p>One expedition in the Revenue Cutter <em>Corwin</em>, searched
for us fruitlessly off Wrangel Land but not daring to enter
the ice, found no trace. A second expedition, in the U.S.S.
<em>Alliance</em>, thinking perhaps we might have drifted east over
North America and come out beyond Greenland into the
Atlantic, searched during the whole summer the fringe of
the polar pack around Spitzbergen, getting in open water as
far as 82° North, five degrees higher than we in the <em>Jeannette</em>
were ever carried by the pack before it crushed us.</p>

<p>But neither expedition found the slightest sign of us, and
more alarmed than ever, an international search was being
organized by our Navy, with the help of England, Russia,
and Sweden for the summer of 1882. In the midst of these
preparations in late December, 1881, from far up in the Arctic
Circle, my first brief telegram from Bulun at last reached
Irkutsk and flashed out over the wires to an astonished world,
ending the mystery of the <em>Jeannette’s</em> disappearance, bringing
joy to some whose friends had definitely escaped; blank despair
to others whose lives were bound up with poor Chipp
and his lost boat’s crew; and a terrible state of mingled fear
and hope, not to be resolved for unknown months yet, to
Emma De Long and the families of those men still with her
husband. I felt that they were dead, but I did not know it,
and dared not say so. I could only announce them as having
landed safely, but yet unfound. My heart ached for Emma
De Long, half the globe away from me, clinging to her
daughter, praying that her husband might yet be alive, tortured
by the long drawn out fear of waiting for word from
Siberia, dreading each knock at the door as announcing the
messenger bringing definitely the black news of his death,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
and all the while with her imagination able to dwell only on
the agonies which her husband had undergone, and if by
some miracle (for which she prayed) he still were living
among those Arctic wastes, he must yet be suffering.</p>

<p>I received <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</i> from Washington for funds to
pursue the search; from St. Petersburg, I was assured all the
resources of Russia were at my command. But Washington
and St. Petersburg were far away from the trackless delta
where I must pursue my search, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</i> telegrams
helped me little. A few dogs, a few interpreters, a supply
of dried fish sold under compulsion by natives who could ill
afford to spare them, was the total extent of the assistance I
could use and get delivered to distant Bulun up in the Arctic
Circle, fifteen hundred long miles away from civilization
and the telegraph wires at Irkutsk, when in late February
with practically all the fish in the Lena Delta in my possession
and the poor Yakuts face to face with famine, I resumed
my search.</p>

<p>Dividing my forces, I sent Bartlett and an interpreter to
cover the eastern branches of the Lena, while with Nindemann
to guide me, I started again to search the western
branches myself.</p>

<p>I had seven dog teams hauling fish, having practically
stripped Jamaveloch and every Lena village of its entire supply.
Delayed considerably still by fierce snow storms, we
went north from Ku Mark Surk into the delta, but it took
two weeks for the straining dogs to drag our stores along
to where the Lena started branching widely at Cass Carta,
and many a burdened dog froze to death in the drifts before
he got there. At Cass Carta at last, I reorganized my remaining
teams and on March 12, still in the midst of-winter
weather, sent Bartlett east, and with Nindemann, began myself
the search of western rivers.</p>

<p>For a week, systematically Nindemann scouted along each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
river, trying to pick out the one that he and Noros had followed
south. But the innumerable storms since had changed
the whole face of that frozen country. How many streams
we examined, I cannot even guess. Nindemann, his broad
brows knit with puzzled furrows, could find nothing familiar
in any of them. Baffled, we gave up searching there and went
far to the north, to follow down De Long’s trail from the
coast, but at the same point where in November I had lost
the track, Nindemann himself was able to do no better in
pointing out the path. And then came a raging storm which
held us snowbound for three days.</p>

<p>Despairingly I considered the situation. Would we ever
pick up De Long’s track? It must be soon or never! Before
long the river ice would break up, we could no longer travel,
and swollen with melting snow from the whole interior of
Siberia, the Lena would come flooding down in torrents to
drown out the low delta lands, washing away forever every
trace of my comrades! De Long must be somewhere to the
south. In desperation, I gave up searching the central delta
for his track, and decided to go back again to the delta head,
to sweep the spreading rivers there as I came north.</p>

<p>Soon after, starting from the southward again, since
Nindemann also felt that there he could do best, we began
at a wide bay, from which one tremendous river flowed eastward
toward Jamaveloch, another flowed westward and
northward toward Tomat, and in between the Lena, in many
smaller branches, flowed due north, spreading widely out
and meandering over the delta, though now of course it
flowed beneath the ice as every stream was still solidly
frozen over.</p>

<p>Following the edge of this tremendous bay, I examined
every headland on it. Broken slabs of ice were piled up in
tangled masses on the banks; the snow, drifted by the winds,
ran in smooth slopes from the river ice to the tops of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
promontories, filling in the banks; dozens of frozen streams,
like twigs spreading from a limb, branched out from the bay,
complicating the search.</p>

<p>Coming in the late afternoon to a high headland on the
western side of the bay, I left my sledge as usual on the
river ice, and clambered up the crust of snow to its top. The
crest was strongly wind-swept and fairly bare of snow; as I
stooped to brace myself against the wind, I saw right on the
point of the promontory signs of a long-dead fire, with half-burned
driftwood logs hove into the wide bed of ashes and
apparently many footprints in the ice about.</p>

<p>Beckoning to Nindemann to come up, I asked him,</p>

<p>“Did you or Noros build that fire here?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Nindemann, “it looks to me we came this way,
but we never had a fire like that.”</p>

<p>I motioned up my dog-driver, questioned him in native
dialect,</p>

<p>“Do Yakuts build fires this way?”</p>

<p>“No, no, master,” he protested volubly, “Yakuts build only
small fires, never big fires like this.”</p>

<p>“Well, Nindemann,” I said, “I think we’re on the trail at
last. This looks to me like a signal fire, especially since it’s
built on this promontory to shine out over the bay. De Long
must have passed here.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” agreed the quartermaster, “that is right. There!
See? There is the old wreck of a flatboat on the bank and
I remember Louis and me passed by that wreck the same
day we left the captain! This is the way we came, and the
captain said he’d follow our trail!”</p>

<p>Going down to the river again, we climbed aboard our
dog sledges. Nindemann on his sledge led along the ice, and
with me following on mine, we set off on a short journey up
the stream to examine the bare skeleton of that flatboat,
stranded on the bank a quarter of a mile downstream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span></p>

<p>I rode, sitting sideways on my sledge, facing the high bank
which rose some thirty feet above the river, and which, as
usual, had hard-driven snow packed in a glistening slope
from its crest down over the frozen river. Going swiftly
along over the ice this way while eagerly scanning the river
bank, I noted standing up through the sloping snow what
seemed to be the points of four sticks lashed together with
a rope.</p>

<p>Immediately I rolled off the speeding sledge, and swiftly
going to the spot, found a Remington rifle slung from the
sticks, its muzzle some eight inches out of the snow. A real
sign of De Long at last!</p>

<p>Instantly I sent my driver to bring Nindemann back, feeling
that here the weakening wanderers might have made a
cache of such belongings as they could no longer carry, and
perhaps even have left a record of their progress. We were
certainly on the trail now!</p>

<p>While the Yakuts at my orders began digging in the snow
around those sticks, Nindemann returned to the flatboat,
and I with a compass again climbed up the steep river bank,
intending to get some bearings from which later I might find
that spot in case a sudden snow-storm should blot out the
way to it.</p>

<p>Panting from my exertions, I looked about for a good place
on that high ground from which to take the compass bearings
when a few steps off, partially buried in the snow still
left on that forlorn and gale-swept height, I saw a copper tea
kettle. With a beating heart, I started for it, then stopped
short. There before me on that desolate plateau, protruding
stiff and stark above the snow—was an extended arm!</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap"><em>Lena
Delta</em></span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>For an instant I gazed, aghast at my discovery, then
dropped to my knees to find that that arm belonged to Captain
De Long! There he lay, cold and silent in death, half
buried in the snow. A yard or two off lay Dr. Ambler, while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>near their feet, closest to where the fire had been beneath
the copper kettle, was stretched Ah Sam. My long search was
ended at last!</p>

<p>Mournfully I looked. There had the saga of the <em>Jeannette</em>
ended, there in the Arctic snows was my lost captain—dead.
For a long time with bowed head, I knelt sobbing before my
commander, whom last I had seen, erect in the cockpit of
his boat in the midst of that roaring polar gale which had
brought swift death to Chipp, waving me on to safety.</p>

<p>As I gazed tear-stricken into his face, calm even in death,
I was struck by the odd position of his left arm, upraised with
open fingers as if, lying there dying, he had tossed something
over his shoulder and his stiffening arm had frozen in that
gesture. I looked behind him.</p>

<p>A few feet away in the snow beyond his head lay a small
notebook, the journal he had kept since the <em>Jeannette</em> sank.
To me it seemed as if De Long, in his dying moment had
tossed that journal over his head, away from the fire at his
feet lest it should blow in there and be destroyed. I seized
the journal and rose. Before me were only three of the captain’s
party—where were the other eight? Perhaps the journal,
if the dying captain had kept it up, might tell me.
Nindemann had parted from the captain on October 9. What
had happened since that day? Hurriedly, I separated the
frozen leaves and turned to the page marked—</p>

<p class="no-indent">“Mr. Collins dying</p>

<p>And there on October 30th, the pitiful record ended.
Before he could put a period to that final tragic sentence,
the pencil dropped from De Long’s nerveless fingers, with
his last conscious effort he tossed his journal over his shoulder
to save that record of what had happened to his shipmates
from the fire nearby. My blurred eyes stared at the
pages before me; my captain had died as he had lived—with
his thoughts only on his men. Not a word on that last tragic
page about himself, his sufferings, or his own approaching
death. And yet for the solitary malcontent who on the
<em>Jeannette</em> had tried the captain’s very soul, who had fought
savagely to destroy the discipline on which De Long relied
to save our health and our lives amid the perils of the Arctic
pack, he could still tax the little strength left in his starved
body to note down,</p>

<p>“Mr. Collins’ birthday; forty years old.”</p>

<p>And so to the final entry, by the irony of Fate recording
that man’s death, the dying captain’s stiffening fingers
scrawled out faithfully the record of his shipmates, but not
one word regarding George Washington De Long!</p>

<p>With wet cheeks, I stood humbly before the frozen body
from which the great soul of my Captain had passed, till
finally Nindemann approached and with his aid, I loosened
the three terribly emaciated forms from the snow and bore
them gently to our sledges. Evening fell and we returned
to a hut at Mat Vay, ten miles south across the great frozen
bay, where I established headquarters. The next few days,
digging in the snow near the tripod where I had found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
rifle, we uncovered the bodies of the rest of the party, all
fearfully gaunt. There was not a whole garment on any
man; and not one pair of boots or of fur clothing could
we find. Everything made of skin or of leather had been
eaten; most of the men lay in ragged underwear with their
feet bound in canvas, and the first two who died had been
stripped naked and so lay in the snow, their poor rags
wrapped round their then dying comrades.</p>

<p>As we dug away the snow in the lee of that river bank
where the last ten survivors (Alexey had died a short distance
away near that grounded raft) had huddled, trying
to shelter themselves from the fierce gales, we found first
the ashes of their fire, then the sticks with which they had
sought to rig their sole remaining piece of canvas as a windbreak,
and then so close to the ashes that their underwear
was badly scorched, the bodies of all hands except Lee and
Kaack. And there also we found De Long’s main ship journals.
But those two men and the expedition’s silken ensign
we could not find.</p>

<p>I puzzled over that, and then reading back again De
Long’s journal, I noted that Lee and Kaack had been carried
“around the corner out of sight.” But where was there
a corner in that bank running straight north and south?
And then it came to me that as all the gales De Long had
logged blew from the southward, they must have set their
bit of canvas up athwart the wind and camped on its north
side, so that he meant around the corner <em>of the tent</em>. Directing
the natives to dig to the southward of the sticks, they
soon found Lee and Kaack, naked both, and now there was
nothing missing but the ensign. Knowing well that De Long,
however weak he might be, would never have abandoned
that, I ordered the edge of the tent line excavated and there
at last we found the silken banner, deep in the snow, safely
rolled in its oilskin case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span></p>

<p>But one thing still puzzled me. Why were the men whose
deaths De Long had recorded all there in the lee of that
high bank, while he himself, with Ah Sam and Dr. Ambler,
the last survivors, lay on top that promontory where there
was not the slightest shelter from the biting wind? After
another survey, I could only conclude that De Long, wholly
despairing of rescue and feeling death swiftly approaching,
had with his two dying companions started to move the records
of the expedition up from the river bank onto the
higher ground where they would longer escape the spring
floods, but the three of them having made one trip up the
slope in which they dragged with them the copper kettle
and a tin chart case (which I found there near the captain)
had none of them the strength to crawl back for another
load and there they all soon perished. Evidently of those
three Ah Sam died first; his arms were crossed above his
breast as if laid out by the others close to the little fire they
had built beneath the kettle in which they were trying to
boil a few twigs of Arctic willow. Whether Dr. Ambler
or Captain De Long was the last survivor, no one will ever
know—Ambler lay face down near the fire, De Long a little
farther off.</p>

<p>At my direction, Nindemann and Bartlett carefully
searched the camp and all the bodies for any final messages
left, but only on Surgeon Ambler did they come across anything
like that. The last page of his journal was in the form
of a letter. I sobbed as I read it.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Atop a rocky promontory looking to the north, towering
four hundred feet above the great bay of the Lena Delta
and far beyond the reach of any possible flood, I prepared
for my captain and his crew their final resting place. Excavating
from the solid rock a foundation, I built in the
form of a huge cairn, a monumental rectangular stone structure
visible easily twenty miles in all directions, making its
sides of the thick planking torn from that wrecked flatboat
near the last fatal camp, and covering the stout planking
with rough stone quarried on the mountain top. Above that
rocky cairn, I raised a massive cross twenty-five feet high,
hewn from a driftwood spar salvaged from the bay below,
and upon the spreading arms of that cross, I cut the names
of those who were to rest beneath it.</p>

<p>When all was ready, on April 6, 1882, on that gale-swept
mountain top overlooking the Lena, we buried them. Composed
wholly of sledges, the long funeral procession of
straining dog teams wound across the snow-covered tundra
and up the ice-coated slopes of that mountain, the dark
sledges bearing the silent seamen standing starkly out against
the whiteness of the driven snow, with the one bit of color
there the <em>Jeannette’s</em> silken ensign draping the cold figure of
her captain. On foot the three survivors present, Bartlett,
Nindemann, and I, trudged sadly along. Arrived at the cairn,
we three lifted the thin bodies from the sledges, tenderly
laid them out on a bed of snow inside the tomb, Captain
De Long at one end, then the others in order of rank: Surgeon
Ambler, Mr. Collins, Lee, Kaack, Görtz, Boyd, Iversen,
Dressier, and last at the other end, Ah Sam. Then reverently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
removing the ensign from the captain’s body that I might
return it to her hands who fashioned it, we took our long
last look at our dead comrades.</p>

<p>In that deep Arctic solitude with no unhallowed lips droning
out unfelt phrases, we who had lived with them in toil
and peril and nearly died with them in anguish, stood with
bowed shoulders and bared heads in the freezing wind before
our dead, and with choking voices murmured our heartfelt
farewell,</p>

<p>“Good-by! Sleep well, shipmates!”</p>

<p>And then sorrowfully sealing up the cairn, we left them
to their rest. Never had heroic explorers a more fitting tomb.
Amidst the Siberian snows, looking out over the Lena’s great
bay at the desolate cape below which had witnessed their
last agony, and northward across that Polar Sea which he
had valiantly given his life to conquer, De Long and his men
of the Jeannette lay at last beneath the huge cross on that
rocky cairn, with the fierce Arctic gales they had so often
bravely faced mournfully wailing their eternal dirge.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="center no-indent">EPILOGUE</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">I am an old man now, looking forward soon to joining those
shipmates of long ago. Many honors have come my way,
and for sixteen years as an admiral in the Navy, I have had
charge of designing and building the throbbing engines
which drive our every warship. That mighty fleet which so
proudly showed the American flag in every ocean on the
globe and has just returned to confound the doubters at
home and abroad who foresaw those ships with broken-down
machinery cluttering every port from Rio to Yokohama,
was my design. The engines and the boilers which so sturdily
drove the <em>Oregon</em> twelve thousand miles around South
America under forced draft in time to take her place in the
forefront of the battle-line at Santiago and deal the death
blows to Spanish sea power, were my creation.</p>

<p>From that day in 1861 when as a young engineer officer I
joined the Navy, until the day forty-two years later when
I retired full of honors as its Engineer-in-Chief, machinery
had been my life and I had hoped that my name might as
a result find its place with that of Ericsson as one who had
done much to advance the application of power to our warships.
But as the years since my retirement weigh me down,
and I see my proud <em>Oregon</em> already vanished from the fleet,
and that fleet itself ere long destined to disappear before the
creations of newer and better engineers than I, more and
more do I realize that it is the men themselves and how they
lived and died, rather than their puny handiwork, which
those who come after us will ever have reason to cherish as
the true measure of any man.</p>

<p>And so that huge cross I reared in the Lena Delta amidst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
the polar snows looms larger and larger in my mind and
now I only humbly hope, as approaching the end of my long
days I look back over my life, that the name of George
Wallace Melville may be a little remembered as one of those
who served on that far-off cruise in the <em>Jeannette</em>, when my
science and machinery faded from all importance, engineering
went wholly by the board, when first with only our
stout ship to shield us and then without her, face to face
with Nature in her fiercest mood for endless months we
battled the Arctic ice beneath the banner of George Washington
De Long, and in his life and death I learned what
truly makes the man.
